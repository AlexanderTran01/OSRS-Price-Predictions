0,jbe3ase,"This seems to address a lot of the feedback so far.

There are some really nice changes in here that add what sound like rewarding skill ceiling gameplay elements, and I think the new elemental prayers are a cool thematic inclusion. Would the blood effect work with all combat styles..?

I think at this point actually testing the 90% dmg reduction prayers in a beta is kinda essential because all this conjecture about how ""awful"" it'd be is pretty baseless (outside of ToA but we all know that invocation is mostly shit because it's underrewarding in terms of points for the inconvenience).",250
1,jbe3kcn,"Cruor's Vow would work with all combat styles yeah, I'll update the blog to reflect as much!",97
2,jbe8g6l,"During the initial proposal I was like: hmm, fine, whatever. But this iteration got me quite hyped really",6
3,jbfo38h,"Given the power of the book, I don’t think we can conclude it’ll feel awful in ToA. 500s are still very possible with the prayer invo on. I think this book will be meta there, and practically everywhere else besides inferno. But we’ll see with beta testing!",1
4,jbe3exk,"For Glacies' Vow, is the bonus magic damage dealt through a secondary accuracy roll, with the damage being based on your main attack?

i.e. attacking with melee, your main attack passes the accuracy roll and deals X damage, Glacies' Vow procs successfully, so you roll a secondary accuracy roll of your melee attack against the target's magic defence, and if that passes, the bonus damage is 10% of X?",72
5,jbe3xpk,"This reads correct to me, yeah!",30
6,jbehzu1,"Seems like it’s worthless then. If you are doing 10 dps (already really high -tbow level) 20% proc chance and 10% damage takes the dps increase to 0.2 dps, and this doesn’t include accuracy checks. Thralls are 0.66 dps, so this, at the very best, is 1/3 of thrall impact. If the monster has a high magic level (many bosses), the second accuracy check means this will be a 0.1 dps increase or less for most players.

Even with no second accuracy check, a 0.1-0.2 dps increase doesn’t seem worth the prayer drain.",17
7,jbe4n7m,Nailed it,3
8,jbeg64f,"I think the prayer turning being poisoned into damage is super cool and really fits thematically with the risk/reward theme and the poison aspect of ancients.  


The description reads that you deal ""bonus poison damage"". I would hate to see that mean that all creatures immune to poison would also be immune to damage from this prayer, as most things that are worth killing can't be poisoned.",27
9,jbgtmy1,Maybe couple it with a way to poison yourself. A new brew or something that restores prayer an poisons you. Could be interesting!,3
10,jbe43jn,"Love the changes!

Overhead accuracy prayer for special weapons is a great mechanic IMO.

The Ancient Vows are exactly what needed to be added, now THESE feel thematic and impactful. The poison one is super cool, though fairly low usage I’d wager lol.

I’m a bit disappointed about overprotection being dropped, but I can understand with that reasoning.

Personally I’m a huge fan of deflect prayers. They can’t be used everywhere, but they’ll definitely be useful for lots of things with that bonus DPS.

Well done! It doesn’t quite feel like it’s there 100%, but I’m loving the direction it’s moving, and it seems pretty damn close.

Keep it up!",135
11,jbeum9o,"The Ancient Vows are *exactly* what the previous iteration of the book was missing. Thematically relevant and unique, interesting mechanics. To me, it was always important that the new prayers didn’t feel like they could just be added into the standard book similar to rigor/augury. These Vows are *clearly* related to Zaros/Ancient Prayerbook.

Honestly, I’d love if they added more Vows in the future. Would love to see what else they can cook up.",22
12,jbfbclk,"If I'm understanding it correctly, Fumus' Vow (poison one) actually seems crazy good when you can use it, to the point where I wonder if it will be used in speedruns against poison-susceptible bosses.

~~Getting pre-poisoned on Karamja tribesmen will add something like 40 damage over 15 hits.~~ Getting venom stacked up to a 20, converting it to a 20 poison by sipping a normal anti poison will add something like 70 damage over 20 hits. If it applies twice with a dds spec or d-knife spec, it'd add 17 damage on the first and 13 on the second which is great for rushing in pvp (blocked by antipoison, as a counter)

Even if you use it just to clear poison, it's great. If you're blowpiping when you get poisoned, you'll reduce a 6 damage poison to 2 damage before it ticks a single time (assuming no re-poison), while gaining 20+ extra damage over 15 seconds or so.

~~BP-ing shamans in CoX will add 6(!) damage a hit when poisoned~~, and you can clear it afterwards without even bringing an anti by bp-ing the next boss/scavs for 20s.

Edit: Shamans are immune to poison, as well as many other poisonous creatures. Prayer seems much more reasonable from that standpoint. 

Also, you can easily get an 'on-demand' maxed out poison stack by partially curing venom if you're willing to wait/eat. Starting with a max severity poison, +17 damage on an AGS+maul (or +36 damage on a claw+maul assuming 4 poison splats) will be...spicy...don't forget your serp.

Edit: numbers",6
13,jbfytij,"I have a strong suspicion that at least one of the DT2 bosses will be poison themed, or at the very least use a strong poison attack like the Kalphite King. So the new poison prayer will be very useful for that.",2
14,jbe509e,"Please address the healing deficit in Vindication. The downsides of other prayers in the prayerbook should be enough, Vindication doesn't need to heal less than Redemption. Healing only 14 hp (Redemption heals 24), it **will be too weak** to use where Redemption is already used. Vespula portal, tightrope skip and Corrupted Gauntlet. In the case of Corrupted Gauntlet, you'd lose 6 doses x 10 hp = 60 potential hp over Redemption.",91
15,jbel0e1,Yeh I feel like this redemptions aim is more around the increase max hit. Feels like a PvP prayer more than replacing PvM usage. It can still suffice to be used as a redemption flick though.,7
16,jbe8lm8,I don't feel like that is an issue. Yeah the cox ones suck but that is the opportunity cost of running this prayer book compared to standard.,0

19,jbebmiw,"> If the Ruinous Powers are added, would you still want a reason to use the standard prayer book?
Yes, the standard prayer book should still have a use.

20,jbffwvh,"You know the answer, a majority of the player base doesn’t seem to care about the health and nostalgia of osrs, so they’d vote to do away with the current prayer book",-12
21,jbf2u7b,"Fumus' vow will be damn powerful at kril or scorpia. Scorpia has poison severity of 96 so you would deal bonus 9 damage with fresh poison then 8-7-6-6-5-4-4.

krill got poison severity of 76 so 7-6-6 bonus damage to first 3 hits.

It's niche, but very powerfull against bosses with high hitting poison.",16

23,jbe3ojx,"Personally i like the new ancient vows, proc chances could be bit higher to reduce randomness. Now on the otherhand vaporise+Glacies' vow is already a powerful combination.

One suggestion for future, a prayer that increases proc chance of enchanted bolts might be fitting, as zaryte crossbow increases the strength of the proc, new prayer that increases the proc chance would synergy well.",63

26,jbe41gz,"I actually quite like these changes. Gambit feels like a good opener now.

The new protection prayer options seem way better as well",29
27,jbe7g3b,"My biggest issue with Gambit.  In the first news post asking for us to come up with idea's they specifically asked us for prayers that cannot be flicked... and well it feels like gambit was specifically made to do just that.. Flick it between protection prayers during your offensive roll. to me it just seems odd and conflicting that they made it like this despite asking for stuff not to be that way.

I think if they want it to be an overhead sure.. but add ramp up time and maybe add some defense bonus to offset not having protection prayers.. Get high accuracy and high defense bonuses with no increased damage but risky chance of getting hit big without protection prayers.",2
28,jbe3clx,"I'm liking these a lot more, the vows look really good and fun",68
29,jbechc8,"Love the vows. Especially the blood one, even if only 1% healing on average feels like nothing considered it’ll be rounded down too. Still can’t wait to use it and the other prayers here!",2
30,jbe3bmm,"These actually look very promising! I'm really excited to test these, I don't really see why the skilling prayers had to be removed since they seemed fun to mess around with, so hopefully they can make a return. The vows are a really cool idea and an excellent addition. Having the higher power prayers locked behind boss drops is excellent, considering they are going to rival rigour/aug which are unlockable from raids. I also don't mind leaving the old prayerbook behind if we get so many interesting additions in this new one. Great job!",65
31,jbe5128,"Wow, the changes are very nice. I was very anti chip damage to begin with. But the fact that the chip damage is also doing damage to my target makes it feel a lot better. 

The vows looks kind of crazy in terms of power.. are they an overhead? or can the be used in conjuction with overheads?

My only gripe I have is vindication is kind of useless with the 15% heal, should be 20%-25% so it can be used at vespula/tightrope.

Overall, very nice changes. Please don't give into the vocal minority asking for curses. This is a WAYYY better design, fit to reward higher skill play.

Thank you for taking in our feedback.",60
32,jbeeqvr,"Coming from another place with that, new chip damage+ ring of suffering recoil sounds like a good way to really start stacking up a ton of recoil damage on a ton of bosses, it might be worth using over raw damage boosting rings.  


\+4 prayer is obvious, +20 more defense stats helps keep chip damage minimalized, and the recoil effect will stack with the 10% already being shot back at the boss.",6

    While active, you have a 20% chance to deal bonus Magic damage.
    This bonus damage rolls off of your equipped style against your target's Magic defence.
    The damage dealt is 10% of your initial hit.""

What does the second point mean here? It's not referring to any accuracy roll, since the first point specifies the chance to deal bonus damage. It's not referring to a damage roll, since the third point specifies how much bonus damage I'll do when it goes off

What an I missing?",5
36,jbe409f,"The 'bonus damage' still needs to pass an accuracy check, is what the second point is aiming for. But the accuracy check is made up of your equipped style (e.g. Melee) vs. your target's Magic Defence.",15

1. you hit the unsuspecting victim  
2. first accuracy check to see if you hit

39,jbexgos,"Deflection prayers are what I’m taking about. If I’m only reducing 90% of damage, I should recoil 10% back to the enemy. It makes for risk vs reward gameplay. Plus it incorporates the recoil effect initially talked about. I feel this is a better spot for overhead protection prayers",4
40,jbfacld,"I guess based on the changes here, I'll need to see how it plays out in the beta. Can't say I'm overly convinced and don't agree with others that the standard prayer book should still be viable. It only goes up to level 77 and these are proposed to be 80s/90s right? 

It's one of those things that I guess will be decisive in the community is do we want an alternative or do we want an upgrade.

Allow prayer flicking for all these prayers and I'd say its balanced. OR make the prayers meaningful upgrades. I don't care if they're upgrades we have to unlock like rigour and so has multiple steps. 

And a totally wild suggestion would be to remove the benefits prayer flicking has on the standard prayer book in reducing cost of prayer points. It isn't comparable to 1.5t teaks or 3t fishing, prayer flicking is literally the most mundane thing unless you're doing gwd.",3

As far as 1T flicking, it seems like they really haven't mentioned since they originally proposed the idea, so i doubt they even prevent 1T flicking these (which they shouldn't prevent that, complete reddit take to pretend 1T flicking is this infinite prayer hack every high level player does non-stop)

EVEN IF they prevent 1T flicking, lazy flicking pretty much covers any actual prayer drain downsides this book would have (particularly with cruor's vow)",0

I *will* say that Fumus' Vow is perhaps just complicated to explain (because poison is complicated) and probably the prayer that I think struggles with what you're talking about the most.

In this case I think they were something the team just had limited confidence in being able to deliver on in an exciting way that also ties in with the trade-off nature of the book itself.

Would still totally understand if you're upset by the decision, but wanted to make it clearer that it's not simply a case of 'we saw Reddit complain and removed x/y/z', since removing prayers like that isn't a decision we'd take lightly and just have other factors at play too.",242

Instead of “We feel this way, so we are removing them,” it should have been “We feel this way, do you feel the same?” resulting in a poll question asking the community if skilling prayers should be temporarily postponed (with a promise to deliver sooner rather than later) with a more fleshed out idea such as a Lunar or Arceuus prayer book.",9

102,jbf9ohm,You haven't addressed the ridiculous amount of power creep in the offensive prayers (~7 max hits on BIS). This is more power creep than the last 4 years of updates at once.,5
103,jbg1jlq,It's also a landmark occasion. There will never be another prayer book dedicated to combat. Having huge quest unlocks is part of the charm of this game.,2
104,jbednjm,"Is there still interest in keeping both prayer books relevant? The original tradeoff was the weaker protection prayers, but if either of the new protection prayers pass, I think the standard book would be completely overshadowed.

Withstand removes chip/prayer damage from encounters that didn't already have it, which was one of the biggest drawbacks before. Inferno comes to mind, which is where the supply drain would have been significant.

Deflect is basically just trading 1:1 with the boss. On bosses that don't hit through prayer, that's a better ratio then venge. I can also see this prayer being stronger than the standard overhead prayers in many cases: HP is another resource to be used to kill the boss faster.",15
105,jbf9kxh,"Depending on prayer drain and ability to flick, it could be more resource intensive or result in shorter trips overall which would impact some bosses.

It also could be more intensive vs leaving an overhead on the standard prayer book on, leading to a situation like the XP tradeoff in skilling with AFK vs active methods.

Those are just my initial thoughts, overall I agree with you, I want both books to be relevant.",1
106,jbee1ou,Really hope you bring skilling prayers soon,17
107,jbf33fn,"Does Berserker work exactly like Preserve, or affect divine boosts too?",3
108,jbfd46i,"Hot take, but that ""wind up"" idea is something you should explore much more deeply in this update. Add some prayers that have a 5-10 second cast time, almost like home teleport, but have absolutely bonkers effects. 

This would preserve the utility of the original prayer book in a pinch, but make the ancient prayers more powerful when used in a planned out way.",3
109,jbffqcd,"I like these!! On the note of the vows I think that 6 poison should be the breaking point for doing more damage than recursive damage glacius vow as it also requires you to tank poison; so maybe it could be ~15% of your poison severity? Also how would this work with venom, would the vow and venom work against eachother taking your severity up and down; or does venom not use the same ""poison severity"" mechanic?",3
110,jbfqwal,"I really love the idea of the vows, Fumus' vow especially. Staying purposefully poisoned in order to get a buff is an awesome idea that ties into the risk/reward theme in a way that makes the prayer book much more unique and distinctive.",3
111,jbfyfpq,"had this idea for making crucor vow a little less 1 dimentional and lean into ""risk vs reward"" and adding skill expression.it's 1%(10% chance of 10% heal) flat currently but what if it was like .5% at 99-70hp 1% at 69-50hp and 1.5% at 25-49 hp 3% at 1-24 hp. 

Also worth talking about potentially making melee heal more like 50% additional on top of those because it's riskier for melee although blood fury in the game so maybe melee could be the same as range / mage for healing with this. 

basically rewarding riskier play and punishing mistakes more, which allows the effect to be more powerful at the lower hp u and not be unbalanced.

remember judge based on ""concept"" not the numbers i just present a concept that adds skill and additional dimentions ot crucor vow which is pretty much a baby soulsplit rn.",3
112,jbgadoj,"Why are so many people allergic to a low life mechanic, it seems like a fun idea",3
113,jbgcyp7,"yeah no idea tbh seems like a no brainer mechanic for the zaros ""high risk high reward"" prayer book lol",2
114,jbgdm3r,How about for protection prayers instead of 100% but lower defense we do 100% but on the wrong prayer youll take for example 125% dmg,3
115,jbh20na,"I like some, not others.  I like the 4 new ancient vows.  I don't like the damage boosting prayers combined with the new smite.  People say the skill cap and speed of PvP is too high now to get new people involved.  Well wait until more recoil, faster smite, and much bigger hits are all incoming.  Also, if you are a wilderness pvmer that doesn't want to pk then all this does is make it easier for people to pk or grief you.

Also the new prayer unlocks for the stronger ones coming from a quest boss is out of line.  Aug and rigour come from a raid.  A quest boss dropping better prayers than the ones from raids isn't the way to go.  Better prayers than rigour and aug should come from content like raids 4 or other high end content.",3
116,jbe57cs,One thing with the protection prayers is that it seems like we're only getting to try one form of them now? I think I'd be interested in seeing how all of absorb/deflect/withstand play out,6
117,jbe5p18,To me they sound good enough to advance to beta testing. Let’s just go from there and see how it goes.,8
118,jbe39wq,"I'm really happy with the current changes. For the most part the prayers seem alright, so I'm looking forward to test them in a beta soon. Not a big fan of the vow prayers tho",16
119,jbe4uky,"I like the 4 new prayers because they actually fit the ice-blood-shadow-smoke theme. The rest of the prayer book should be designed this way. At the moment it’s a jumbled mess of curses, normal prayers but with tradeoffs, and new fresh ideas. Removing skilling prayers is a step in the right direction.",11
120,jbeydqa,"Exactly. Those vows are actually unique and work. They also need to remove the flat offensive prayers and make them gain strength/sap over time until they outclass the current book after x seconds of combat. 

I’m its current state, I just don’t think it’s acceptable. Just a jumbled mess of ideas.",2
121,jbeh4rm,When and where will we be able to vote? I don’t see the option anywhere in the blog or in game,5
122,jbh5duj,"In game, go to any polling booth(they're in most banks)",2
123,jbep2e3,"I think <100% effectiveness deflect prayers is a good idea. The new book having 100% prayers comparable to the old book will make the old book mostly obsolete, especially if the new book has such similar prayers to the old one like it does now. The ancient vows look fucking incredible though. Extremely unique, available with any other prayers, effects that are absolutely worth using despite the extra prayer drain. I like the inter-book synergy as well, where taking the chip damage from the reflect prayers makes you need to eat more, and you can lose less dps while eating by using the C O N S U M E prayer. This is a much better direction, and I really hope they don't go with the withstand option. It's just more boring and defense is already one of the more worthless stats in the game.",4
124,jbfywju,"Would you consider a buff to the redemption? The amount of healing it provides is kinda too low for the cases where redemption is used now and so you're basically chancing a death everytime you use it, I'm not sure that the +10% is worth the potential death in places that you'd normally use it (cox, thermy, etc), I feel like chugging a restore is also fair for this, Redemption is kind of already inherently high risk since it drains and turns off your prayer.

The old proposed rebuke option was kind of neat for venge, I'd love to see the math from before and after this change on dps from venge, since this may lower the DPS of venge to the point where you don't ever use it in the places that it might have replaced thralls before? (Though to be fair in the case of lunar's you don't always have to choose just one or the other, but it is a lot of runes to bring)  


For Fumus' Vow, does this proc of venom as well? Or completely unrelated?",3
125,jbgnc0y,"Why not remove redemption from the book entirely? The prayer book needs more drawbacks and I dont think we need to copy every prayer from the old book.

It should be more like the different spell books, where each book has major advantages, but is missing key aspects of the other books.",0
126,jbh8pfr,Redemption doesn't need buffs. You use them for the i-frames not healing.,1
127,jbe359r,"For 'metabolise' with the current proposal there is still an issue with skilling where you can abuse it for 1t skilling interactions.

E.g. Currently on the live game it works like this - start a 3t cycle and cut a tree, once that is done, immediately eat a karambwan, this will add 2t to your skilling timer, allowing you to get another log on the 5th tick, and repeat. However with metabolise you will only get 1t added, so you will get 2 logs in 4t instead of 5t.

Crab meat could also be used to get another 1t interaction in the middle however nobody makes crab meat so there isn't any in the game to worry about.

This seems like a bit of an oversight, so could the skilling timer be unaffected by this prayer?",6
128,jbe4byq,A 1t skilling method that requires you to eat a Karambwann each action means you get less then 20 seconds of skilling before you have to bank and refill prayer. Is this really better than current than current 3t/1.5t methods in any meaningful way?,18
129,jbe68s3,"/u/JagexGoblin can you guys confirm if performing 2t cycles (alternating 3 tick 1 tick) by eating karambwans/gnome food while praying Metabolize is intended? (Similarly, 2t cut eat barb fishing by eating roe/potion mixes)

If not, is it possible to have the prayer only function if the player is/has been in combat recently (or some other change to address this)? Thanks!",2
130,jbemxw1,This is jagex. Id just delete the post as theyd prob delete tick manip or fuck it up trying to keep it.,1
131,jbeairj,"Smite, Wrath and Rejuvenation being small upgrades/equivalents to the normal prayer book feels really boring.",6
132,jbed6ul,In poll 78 we voted on a balance of combat and skilling prayers and now we don't have any skilling prayers? Why is this??,11
133,jbeiz6i,Where in the polling charter does it say we will ignore the in-game poll that ran for a week in favor of the survey we put on a blog that was open for a day,10
134,jbexz50,[deleted],0
135,jbe8ayn,"Honestly such a huge step up for me personally! I love the vows, they fit thematically and seem worth it without being OP. Although I would still hope for the offensive prayers to be not just ""get buff"" (e.g. ranged bonuses depending on tiles from target, or melee bonus scaling from weapon speed), I get that that would make the prayers a bit too convoluted. I do see room to bring these into the vows though. The damage from Glacies' vow could very well depend on weapon speed, favouring slower weapons to give them more viability and a shattering 'oomph' for example.

One question: how does Fumus' vow work with venom?",7
136,jbev3p7,I was also hoping to see a little more creativity in the damage prayers. I even had the same idea of accuracy based on tiles from the target! I'm also curious how the poison vow would work with venom. hopefully we get an answer.,2
137,jbfeis0,"The vows are really bad though. We already know Curors vow won't be used anywhere period, because it has the same exact stats the blood fury did on release and it had to be buffed to be **x6 as powerful** to even be viable to use. Currently you'll get approximately 1% of your DPS back as healing. Which if you're doing 10.00 DPS (that's being generous tbow/max set/stats) you're getting .1 health per second. Literally your natural health regen is better than this prayer.",-1
138,jbeduj7,No update today? just a blog?,2
139,jbf1qk4,Tomorrow we get the update.,2
140,jbf34rg,These prayers are looking much more rewarding for the requirements while still not being a direct upgrade from the original prayer book but still a somewhat upgrade. Much more excited for this now!,2
141,jbh5lc9,"I do think they need more tradeoff. Maybe take some of the power out of the base offensive prayers and put it into gambit, so you have to risk being hit off prayer to get more power.",2
142,jbfan6d,"So let me make sure I've got this right...1/10 poison severity rounded down added as ***guaranteed*** damage?

Zammy GWD poison hits 16s, so let's assume that a poison severity of **80.** This means your next four attacks will be given **+8, +7, +6, +5** damage respectively.

Including the new Melee Damage Prayer, Dragon claws max **92**.

Would this mean claws now max **92 + 26** ***guaranteed*** damage? Let's also throw a granite maul in there (another **+5** ***guaranteed*** damage from Fumus' Vow)

With dragon claws -> gmaul, you can now stack **92+52** damage *while also dealing a* ***guranteed +*****31** damage from the vow, totaling now **175** damage in two attacks while also curing your own poison.

Gets even more fun with Veng+Ice Barrage, of which Ice Barrage would also net your sequence another **+4** ***guaranteed*** damage for a potential stack of upwards of **215** damage!",2
143,jbfoxav,no that's not how it will work,1
144,jbfueyh,"I'm pretty sure the effect only happens on your next hit after a poison splat. Abusing that in pvp could still be a concern, but there's NO way it happens on every hit you do while poisoned, as that would be most broken prayer in runescape (rs3 included) history.",1
145,jbfgbby,"I am not that knowledgeable about PvM but if I read these prayers and protection prayers will be 100% protection I don't see myself ever swapping back to the original book tbh. I don't mind this but if the intention is to keep both books attractive they are not getting to this point for me personally.

But like I said I am pretty noob when it comes to PvM and mostly listen to what the better PvMers tell me to use.",2
146,jbfha1v,These prayers look amazing and feel much better than the original! Great work.,2
147,jbfmsqn,"I feel like the vows are especially powerful prayers, it could be fun to lock those behind a boss using the prayer scroll mechanic: making the prayers a little bit more exclusive and also adding a nice drop to the bosses!",2
148,jbg3t3z,"How would the new poison prayer work with venom (or more accurately, how does venom work via poison sensitivity) 

Does venom just increase your poison sensitivity by 10, or does it work entirely differently",2
149,jbgb9pu,"Such a big blog post with so many details. I'm not going to dive into it, but I do appreciate how much effort the team is putting into it. I'll just wait until the smart people have figured the balancing out and it's added to the game and I will enjoy it :)",2
150,jbgcf5i,Why we need to drop best prayers as a scroll from bosses its already locked behind the quest.,2
151,jbgcr1t,because the arguement is that it's just a single mid game difficulty quest for it to give such an insane upgrade is overly power creep. makes sense for it to have a few more steps for tis full power,1
152,jbgi5v5,"I really like the idea of the Vow prayers having unique gameplay mechanics. Got me thinking about another concept: what about a prayer that ramps up it's power linearly over time at the cost of increased prayer consumption over time? Could work something like:  
\- Starts at low cost low power (maybe 5-10%)  
\- After around 10-20 seconds it ramps up to the power of the other prayers (25-30%), but the prayer cost is higher than those options  
\- By 30-40 seconds the bonuses are really high (maybe 40+%) but the prayer consumption is extreme, requiring constant drinking of prayer potions

Eventually you wouldn't be able to keep up and your prayer and bonuses would drop or you would be forced to turn it off yourself. It could be particularly useful when planning for instances where you need high dps (ToA P2 Wardens core as an example) but constantly using it wouldn't be optimal due to the high prayer consumption. I think it could be a fun change of gameplay effectively racing against your prayer meter to make the most out of the high bonuses as possible.  
One concern I see with this is the pvp implications, since any extra damage in that scene can be extremely polarizing. With that being said it could potentially have reduced effect there.",2
153,jbguufu,"I liked the new ancient Vows, they're different and pretty cool. % values in prayers still feel underwhelming though. There is still a bit of work to be done to make this prayer book different and great.",2
154,jbgvwun,yeah i made a suggestion about crucor vow should have a scaling/bracketed healing % based on missing hp etc just to add more skill and dimentions,1
155,jbeg9l3,"I don't really understand why the skilling prayers were removed. Was this because of the survey? Or Reddit comments? 

I hope it wasn't the latter. The poll numbers clearly showed a fair amount of support, even if people here didn't like it.",8
156,jbegsvw,Sooo are the skilling prayers just gone now? The majority of players voted for a balance of combat and skilling. The initial proposal was 3 skilling and 19 combat which was a joke. And now they're just gone? What?,6
157,jbertkh,My guess would be a lot of people responded in the survey saying they would rather have them in a different prayerbook. Hopefully theyre still being considered there,0
158,jbe6qm6,"79.7% people wanted at least some skilling prayers, over 50% wanted a balance of skilling & combat. Why on earth did you remove the skilling prayers?!?",11
159,jbe9d0f,"Besides the bits they explained in the blog, I think it's been a sentiment that many people voted to include skilling prayers in this book under the assumption that was the only way to get them.

Ultimately they could have just never asked about skilling prayers in the first place, but at least this way they know there's appetite for them.

I think in the long term this will result in better designed prayers for both combat and skilling",10
160,jbeqss9,"* Protection Prayers - Big fan of the deflection prayers. Feel much cleaner and simpler than all the other options and fits the theme well too. Has there ever been any thought about adding ""double protection prayers""? IE: A prayer that grants say 75% protection from two combat styles at the same time? Ever since I saw the Kalphite Queen as a kid I always thought something like that would be cool.

* Offensive prayers - I like all of them tbh. Might be cool to push the damage bonus on Vaporize, Annihilate and Decimate more while actually decreasing your own defense. As it stands the fact that they give 0 defense bonus is also a good trade off for increased power.

* Ancient Vows - Now we're talking. Love the creativity. Really feels different than anything in the standard prayer book, and makes me want to log in and really get that new book and test them out.

* Love Ruinous Grace and Metabolize just as they are. They were my favorite prayers from the initial proposal so I'm glad they're still here unchanged.

I also actually like that the skilling prayers were removed. I liked the prayers, but thematically they didn't fit all that well. If there was ever a ""Lunar Prayer book"" or even just Lunar prayer scrolls focused on skilling they'd fit perfectly in there.

All in all a really positive update",4

Start umbra until you're at max drain, swap to glacies until you feel you need healing then go to curor and back to glacies when you're hp is good again. 

... and never use fumus until someone finds a meme strat to get poisoned by a tribsemen/cave crawler, kill a boss near a teleport, cleanse/heal and repeat.",5
165,jbe95q7,"I’m struggling to see what’s weird about that, how is it any different from changing overheads as a boss does different attacks, or changing to different offensive prayers when you change combat style",10
166,jbf8dd1,"Fumus sounds like it will be super powerful at some niche applications. At Kril for example. If I'm reading the blog correctly, since Kril applies 16 poison damage, that means a severity around 70-80. So a would do an extra 7 damage for the first hit, 6 for the next, and so on. So it can be a large amount of bonus damage wherever you were getting poisoned anyway. General application, not really used as you mentioned.

Poison dealing bosses like Vorkath, Zulrah, Kril, KBD, Sire, Hydra, Scorpia, and Shamans might be enough to get a substancial boost without needing an antipoison. Might even be slightly useful at lesser poison dealing spots like Olm, but I'm not sure if rounding down the 10% severity would even do anything there. Maybe 1 extra damage.",1
167,jbfcmbf,"reposting my above comment:

But imo the others are pretty strong. 15% defense reduction will be extremely useful. The poison mechanic seems like it will be situationally very good. 

I suppose Glacies’ cow might not be that good either. 2% extra magic damage on your attacks seems strong, but the separate accuracy role will make it situationally useless and much lower than 2% in other situations, depending on the targets magic defense.

Was this meant to be a mechanism to prevent players from flicking the prayer on just for a tick while they eat a food? I don't really see a need for any tick manip at the end in the old implementation or a startup delay in the new implementation, but understanding your guys' vision for the prayer might illuminate that. Honestly,  overall I'd say I don't see a reason to make the skill harder to use. But I'm also just a player that doesn't see nearly the full picture, so I'd love to hear jmod perspective.

Also, I feel like blood and ice prayers seem rather underpowered on first inspection. Blood is doing <1% lifesteal when considering rounding. Over the course of an average slayer task (dealing 10k-20k damage), you'd get 5-10 sharks of value out of it, compared to how much prayer usage?  Or in a zuk fight, where you'll deal somewhere around 2k-2.5k damage, that's 20-25 hp gained back on average. What use case would you expect players to use this? 

Ice is dealing <2% extra dps on an npc with a negative magic defense roll. Compare that to the impact of the 5% strength prayer. I get there's other dps prayers and they can stack up quickly if bonuses are multiplicative, but this really doesn't seem to me like something worth spending prayer points on. I may well be wrong though.",1

Put a cool down so you cant flick it to gain the benefit and even remove the prayer drain effect if it’s necessary.

If people wanted it to be a direct upgrade then question about the type of protections was a trap.

This community kills me along side the jmods that were just as bad at the game if they even played pre eoc. Everybody claims to have played since 2006 but im going to be real yall was at the freaking yew trees. Your pvm was the roaches that dropped rune scims. It wasnt until you had weapons like the staff of arma, chaotics nex armours, divine pvp weapons/armours that you likely (if at all) touched any of the things youre scared of now. For years there has constantly been a this or that killed the game, summoning being a great example here.
Pre eoc the game was doing better than oldschool right now. Jagex’s approach to how they handled rs3 was short sighted between mtx and eoc. Its a different game entirely NOW but everything before eoc minus mtx that has no place anywhere they all flow with the game. It is on the community to make sure its at a pacr thats acceptable and even help create alternatives if necessary but dont be in such a denial as to say it doesnt have a place.

It took torva divine overloads and cls to camp soulsplit at. Bandos. Torva having a life bonus and significantly tougher stats than torva in this game. Cls does not exist, overloads not in, divine not in and turmoil sapping its strength far quicker than it should. 

The curses were great, and did change some metas but admittedly the normal prayers were still used for rigour and augury and adding their turmoil variants would reduce people using the normal prayers but it seems as though most people wanted it to be an upgrade in every way. If adding a 4-6t delay before soulsplits heals take effect were proposed any content creator should be able to acknowledge that soulsplit is immediately not op. People talking about chambers and healing to full while using it meanwhile you can simply just take no damage anyway? The delay on heals make sure you arent flicking it in zebak, or wardens or anywhere tbh. Slower charge on the prayers strength ensure that you are pretty much stuck leaving it on, think p1 (post obelisk youll lose dds max hits if you dont keep turmoil on till you down the warden and after you down it, so you dont have rig or aug when trying to down it in the first place.

Otherwise you basically have a 10% chance to heal 0-7 hitpoints depending whether you hit between 0 and 79 damage on that 10% chance...

Fumus' Vow sounds interesting, tho there's so little enemies who can be poisoned, even players can be immune for long amounts of time.

If you're concerned about encouraging people to camp 1 hp all the time (I'm not personally) you could cap it at like +15% accuracy or whatever feels right.

Protection prayers - withstand+deflect or even just withstand feels like the best option. Rewards praying appropriately 

Over protection - removing this feels weird, the point on inexperienced players smiting themselves seems irrelevant, now they can't even try to protect items and one could just use standard spells if this is a concern.

The vows - I don't usually vote on multiple accounts on principle but would break that to vote no to Cruors vow. I really really don't want a healing prayer. There is no version of soul split I'd be interested in. Blood fury was already a mistake please don't add more.

I'm grateful the skilling prayers will find a new home later on, for 1 they don't fit alongside the theme of the current book, and for 2, evidently the devs need a lot more brain storming time to be able to come up with relevant, useful and interesting prayers for skilling which are more than just +1 resource or -1 tick.

What do you think about leaning into this more, and away from the ""slight changes to the risk-benefit calculus of the normal book""  approach, and expand the approach that vow powers take?

  
Some of the things that came to mind when reading the poll blog:

* Why must DPS-increasing prayers be combat-style specific?
* if prayers could transform the styles of incoming and outgoing damage, does that seem like an interesting mechanic to explore?  

* Osmumten's Fang and Lightbearer were examples of new additions whose power were generally under-appreciated until after release. Increased engagement in beta testing may likely have mitigated problems (looking at you, Fang calculation) with players understanding of the benefits that aren't expressed neatly as ""x% better or worse than existing content"" 

&#x200B;

* If technically feasible, could the behavior of prayer points be fundamentally altered while utilizing Ruinous Powers?  In other words, prayer points as a resource could regenerate in a way similar to special attack or health, possibly being altered by prayer bonus and levels, or even other mechanics like sapping prayer from enemies?  

* Finally, can we get several book options added to the beta, and let people try them out? Seems like all of this effort of asking whether to add the current ideas to beta could be used to develop more creative ideas to beta test.  We don't need fancy animations or anything, and coding a prayer for beta test is probably wayyy less effort than trying to explain its behavior precisely to thousands of people on reddit every 3 hours.",1

I like that the low hp effect was removed.  Frankly.. If you want to keep it as an overhead prayer.. Here is my take.. 

Increase your accuracy by 8%-30% over X time period (you choose the ramp up time), Also Increases your Defense bonus by 20-40%(same ramp up time).. 

Why the defense? Well since its an overhead and you cannot have protection prayers on i think its a gamble or a Gambit.. to get higher accuracy with less protection.. the defense wont help in all situations but it will help.. situationally..

Love Berserk coming back.. great prayer..

Vows are cool too, as a whole this is a lot better than the first iteration. Some are still incredibly powerful, but honestly I don’t fully dislike that since high level prayer deserves to have some impact. 

I’ll reiterate a point from the last thread that I made though, which I think is more impactful now - previously, 3/22 prayers in this book related to skilling, which wasn’t at all what players voted for (the winning question was “an even mix of combat and skilling”). Now, those prayers have been removed entirely. It’s concerning to me that a poll result is essentially being ignored with the justification of “the team isn’t confident they can deliver on these,” especially when there have been some good ideas tossed around in these threads and on the sub as a whole in the last month for what these may look like. It’s not great that Reddit feedback + a survey that can be voted on infinite times, AND that most people didn’t know about, can be used to change a poll result because Jagex essentially didn’t want to put in the effort to make these prayers good. Ignoring poll results is an awful precedent to set here, especially when it’s because “well, you didn’t like the absolute minimum effort we put in, so we’ll just kick this can way down the road.”",0

Maybe if Cruor's Vow is strong enough to mitigate the chip damage caused by the bleed-through... But then I have to think how hard is my prayer going to drain for having Cruor's Vow, Deflect from Missiles, and Vaporize all active at the same time? I hope it's not much worse than Augury+Protect from Missiles and maybe Preserve is now.  


Wasn't one of the original goals of this to be less/no prayer flicking? If so why are we having Gambit at all? It's kinda interesting but nothing about this prayer book is encouraging no-flicking like a turmoil effect would have.   


Vows, some interesting stuff going on there, numbers certainly need tweaking. I don't really like smoke's, but maybe it's fine?

404,jbf1u6q,"Cruor's vow is bad, mainly because it would allow for many more mistakes. I got hit an 80 by Akkha while butterflying? I'll just soul split my way back up to 99 hp.

However, on the flip side. Sustain could help against chip damage. We know chip damage is very annoying. Dying of no fault of your own is the worst feeling. As much as we should be tackling core issues separately, Cruor's vow could give a chance to change this. So, here's a suggestion for a drawback:

&#x200B;

Cruor's vow only heals you when you're under 15% hp. That way, you would still be in one-shot range for most PvM encounters, not allowing you to make free mistakes while also negating incoming chip damage that normally punishes you of no fault of your own. Thoughts?",-1
405,jbfn3xw,"You’d need to do 8,000 damage to Akkha to heal that damage back… I don’t know about you, but you should be good enough to not get hit there if you are fighting an Akkha with 8k health lmao.",2
406,jbfw1mb,"Cruor's vow is bad, but not because of that. if you take 80 damage at akkha, you need to hit 8000 damage on average to get that hp back currently. Akkha is dead by then.

Cruor's vow is bad because now you just always lazy flick it at every single boss fight while you're not 99 hp, which is not particularly good gameplay. It's admittedly not very strong at 1% effective healing, and that's the problem, you can't introduce this without making it eventually ""good enough"", at which point it's meta-defining and used everywhere always. It's just a toxic design that can't be balanced, it's either useless or always used.",2
407,jbfpkjl,"One of those Vows is just Soul Split. That will break the game so badly.

I also really don't like the overhead offence prayer, I think that is healthier to implement as an accuracy buff on the next attack that has a cool down to use. Time it on your specs but not something to flick on and off with overheads because that just becomes cumbersome",-1

I could see 88.4% of people choosing offensive prayers here. But that question was asking if you were forced to choose between the two.

419,jbec3sl,"In the Ruinous powers proposal, the prayer Rebuke is said to reflect 15% of damage taken, but increase damage taken by 15%. Would the increased damage taken check your overhead on-cast of the monster, and then the reflect would check your overhead on-hit?

That is to say, if the reflect aspect checks the overhead that the player is praying the tick that the damage arrives, then it would be possible to pray a protection overhead to protect against the casting tick of the monster attacking you (because of projectile time), and then quickly switch to Rebuke after to reflect the damage without getting the increased damage taken penalty. I'm not necessarily saying that this is bad or OP, just curious about how it will be implemented. It could offer a skillful element of prayer switching.

To me, it seems to boil down to ""ancient magic combat, lunar magic skilling, so prayers should be too"". That's a false equivalence if I ever saw one. There's no reason it *has* to be that way. Personally, I think it's a good opportunity to expand on Zaros, rather than being restricted to such a one-dimensional perception.

1. I can’t see Zaros being a fan of prayer flicking as a mechanic; especially with the existence of the tribrid prayer a 10-tick windup doesn’t seem unreasonable for overheads.

I think it’s a wise choice to remove skilling prayers for now. They don’t really fit the theme, but the indication that they will still come is good news. On the other hand I think the new vows look great - they definitely fit the theme and can 100% see them being locked behind raid/quest/boss etc. 

Finally, regarding the protection prayers I think the reworked options both look pretty valid. 100% mitigation but with more risk is good because it means that the skillbook is just as viable, but with the risk that you have to play a little smarter. The reflect option also works because it is entirely in the theme of  sacrificing defence for more offense (whilst not being completely pointless).

Make it so that you're signalling to your team that you're sacrificing -40% dps because you can't manage your supplies properly. The community shame and flame will balance the prayer accordingly.

Real talk, the proposal seems fine and like blood fury has demonstrated there can be a place for lifesteal in OSRS. The numbers are small and that's good because they can be increased later but not necessarily decreased. The problem with blood fury, however, is that for a maxed main doing end game pvm the cost and opportunity cost is basically non existent. Consuming 1m in supplies is nothing when the content is capable of pumping out 10x that, and the dps loss of downgrading from tort to fury (-5 accuracy, -2 str, +15 defence and +3 prayer) aren't anywhere near severe enough to balance how good of an item it is. 

The only place where blood fury is balanced is on an ironman, where the time to obtain them isn't worth the food savings outside of appropriately difficult and worthy situations (500 kits, sub 25 kc tob / hmt, etc). However, as mains have told us time and time again—the game shouldn't be balanced around irons—so the new lifesteal method needs to have a cost associated with it that isn't trivial to overcome for the majority of the playerbase.",0

Defensives should absolutely go the way of withstand/deflect.

Massive drain on both prayer AND life, lump them all in together. Dampen all damage, but take periodic chip damage.

It should be weak enough that it can’t really be camped anywhere other than like slayer (where protection prayers can be camped anyway) and since you’d take extra damage through prayers it could balence itself out.

**Offering:** Overhead. Reverse smite. Gain prayer points when dealing damage. Great for refueling the shield below.

**Divine Shield:** Overhead. Reduce all damage by 70% (35% in PvP). A % of the damage is drained from prayer. Maybe 20% like the divine spirit shield. Counts as a ""Protect"" prayer.

**Ancient Strength/Sight/Will:** \+20% offensive stat. Same as in the blog but melee is merged (attack + strength together). Slightly weaker than the Saradomin prayer book prayers because you'll also do recoil damage.

**Unholy Armor:** Gains % defense based on missing HP. Can be turned on alongside one of the ""Ancient"" prayers above.",-5

520,jbega75,"There's a lot to think over here with how these prayers will interact with existing systems and items in the game bur overall look interesting. 

1 big question I have is does the defense draining prayer work on top of bgs and dwh specs? If so would the extra defense reduction be able to go passed set minimum defense like in toa so you could reduce zebeks defense beyond 30 or whatever it's set cap is?

The other prayer that returns some of the damage back to you as health, would it work on top of blood fury? Worried it might become busted with all the damage boosts but I really like the idea of having sustain.

Overall I like most if not all of these ideas I'm just concerned some of these could be combined to make some of the harder content extremely easy. But that's what rhe bets trial will be for so we can trst these out. So with that in mind I'll be voting yes.

I hope jagex doesn't give up on the new prayer book as a whole and drop it if they don't immediately receive good feedback on these ideas either. I understand they don't have a whole lot of development time for these but this is the most exciting part of the new quest.",1

Punish Melee/Ranged/Magic
100% damage block against given damage type, slows the next attack by 0.6 seconds if you're hit, or hitting with the corresponding damage type.



Nullification - Damage lowers prayer instead of hitpoints. The bleedthrough from an attack that 0's prayer points is doubled.



Have you also considered for the magic prayers just adding flat +max hit to them, would make them unique.",1

527,jbeh923,Removed overprotection was the only thing I was looking forward too grinding out wildy tbh I think these prayers are lacking There’s no WOW factor which from these new prayers and I think that’s what a new prayer book objectively needs,1
528,jbeh9pv,"I like this round of prayers a lot more than the first one. The Vows sound really cool and really match the theme for the prayer book. It would be cool to have them unlock from a drop from the 4 bosses, 1 from each respective boss. It could work like Vorkath's head where it is a 1/50 drop but has the pity drop at 50kc if you got unlucky. Or you could give the player a weaker version that gets upgraded with the drop from the boss, kind of like unlocking its full power. Additionally, the new ancient scepter gems could boost the prayers effects or have some sort of effect.

I was very anti-chip damage from the first round of prayers and like these ideas much more, though the deflect is probably too busted for people actually good at the game. The balance for the protection prayers in this prayer book should be balanced around drain rate and other de-buffs like the defense lowering or taking increased damage from other styles while active. Chip damage just isn't a fun mechanic to deal with imo.

The Gambit change is interesting because I don't really like the low-life idea. It just isn't useful for the vast majority of players and isn't that interesting to me. Instead, Gambit should be prayer for spec accuracy. Imagine changing it to something like 5% accuracy on all styles and an additional 5%-10% accuracy on a special attack. This would help mitigate missing you dwh or bgs spec in raids but not make it too strong for use with all styles. I am unsure of the PvP ramifications of this change though so it may need to be toned down for PvP or maybe it is fine.",1

About the overheads, I like Withstand, although I think the defense reduction needs to be more than 33% in defense stat.

If you want to cover pures, and also make it more impactful, it could be ""take 33% more damage from other combat styles"".

On the topic of the protection prayers, you're already giving up access to piety/rigour/augury, so there's effectively a 20% defence reduction active just for choosing the spellbook. Perhaps it could be possible to choose either the partial protection + recoil or the full protection + defence reduction (as a toggle, not in combat) so that there can be some flexibility to use some of the other interesting niche effects in more places?",1

I'm not sure if it'd be better to basically have the combat boosting prayers (specifically the ""eyes"" and the ""skins"") either take up one slot but get upgraded at the respective current levels or scale with your prayer level. Another idea I had to change up how the prayers worked is if instead of slowly draining, they are spent. Like spend 5 points and get x boost for y period of time or spend x points to damage/heal y or whatever. It does take away some of the skill that is prayer switching, but not every prayer needs to have this mechanic.

Also an alternative approach that I would be okay with is 100% damage reduction from damage type but X% increased damage from other types instead of lowering defence.

607,jbgldfp,Just poll the skilling prayers and put them on the normal book gated behind fairytale part 2,1
608,jbglxrd,"Vows look really good. I'd like to see more things like that, but ah well. The blood vow is effectively a weaker soul split too, but with none of the baggage.

Also, ask about skilling prayers in game. This reward is already very contentious. The last thing it needs is a design aspect that goes against what 80% of players want.",1
609,jbgtlx4,80% didn't want skilling prayers on the zaros book they just wanted the potential of skilling prayers do be considered in the future (it's own prayer book etc),1
610,jbgmb24,"For the ruinous damage prayers, I think having the respective prayer unlocked on the standard book would be a requirement for using its ruinous counterpart, especially if they are going to be straight dps hpgrades to rigour/augury. It seems silly to powercreep raids rewards from solo content that we unlock after finishing a quest.   

It's a little tricky because then there would be 2 unlock conditions for those prayers - the CoX scroll (which has no lore correlation, but should be utilized for the sake of game balance), and a secondary condition (I.e. a scroll dropped by one of the solo bosses). It's not an ideal solution, but I would much rather have it this way then having the CoX prayers as dead content in player progression if they could be ""skipped""  

On the topic of the new prayers, I actually enjoyed the previous renditions where you either took hp chip or prayer chip - I think that it would create scenarios where you would have to balance your use of either protection to preserve your supplies throughout an encounter. These new prayers are neat, the recoil one sounds like it feels a lot better because now you and your target are both sharing the chip damage.

My one qualm is Trinitas. It might sound a little elitist, but I am really not for a prayer that is switch-dissuading, especially on a prayer book that is supposed to be ""endgame"" and risky to use. Even though it offers less than the dedicated style variants, it's too free of an offensive prayer.",1
611,jbgn0n0,"For things like deflect, would this effectively lower the dps of bosses that already hit through prayer like Hunllef? For instance, Corrupted Hunllef maxes a 13 in T1 with the correct protection, would that instead be rounded down to say a 6 with 90% protection, while also dealing 6 damage back?",1
612,jbgtg8a,yes if it hits 60 off prayer then its its 6 through 90%s and reflects a 6,1
613,jbhxcsi,"In this case, assuming Hunllef treats protection prayers at 75% of their original strength, the deflect prayers should only be blocking 67.5%, so the max hit should be like 16 (and it should deal a maximum of 5 back to the Hunllef)",1
614,jbgyhgg,"Something super important everyone should remember (especially mods) is that the new vs. old prayers should be balanced as a prayer book, not by individual prayers (prayer-by-prayer abilities). What I mean by this, is in the new prayer book you could have some very strong (objectively better) prayers for certain attributes/activites, but very weak prayers in other categories. For example, if the new prayer book had insangely good offensive prayer bonuses BUT only had protection prayers that protect 80-90% of damage (no recoil) that could balance out to make both viable in difference circumstances. Same thing with prayers like protect item, smite, etc.",1
615,jbir7k1,yeah right now the prayerbook as a whole is overly superceding the current,1
616,jbgzes9,"* Gambit being 8% is a bit arbitrary - why not 10%?
* Would metabolise let you eat a karambwan then attack with only a 1 tick delay? (Not necessarily a bad thing)
* Rebuke - deflection prayers already deflect 10%, so perhaps this prayer which doesn't protect you should instead deflect e.g. 20% damage, and instead of increasing damage taken it could lower your defence so you are more likely to get hit? And this would make it combo with vengeance better.
* Vindication seems perhaps a little too high risk, not amazing reward?
* Protect item - some form of protection prayer should exist - otherwise being smited means nothing. Also ""Some felt the self-Smite effect would punish less-skilled players too heavily in PvP"" - you know what would punish them even more? Not even having the chance to protect any items.Personally I think double protection but higher chance to get smited seemed appropriate, but at the very least the standard protect item prayer should be on the prayer book (perhaps with a slightly higher prayer drain?)
* Berserker - fantastic. 100% should be on the prayer book, and only having it affect combat stats is appropriate.
* Protection prayers - deflection prayers 100%. Love it. (Perhaps it could make attacks against you do a minimum of 1 damage if they hit you and do damage between 1-9? So it isn't identical to normal protection prayers against enemies that can't hit higher than a 9?And the deflection damage could also be minimum of 1?)
* Ancient precision/sight/will are pointless. Worse than piety and anyone who completes desert treasure 2 will have piety, and they are worse than the other upgraded offensive prayers on this prayer book.
* Trinitas is pointless - anyone who completes desert treasure 2 will be able to prayer switch, and using this prayer as opposed to prayer switching will harm players in the long run.
* Decimate/annihilate/vaporise - seem good. Powerful but traded off by worse protection prayers.
* Cruor vow - incredibly weak. 1% of damage dealt as healing on average? Does it at least always heal at least 1 hit point when it triggers? If you can use it alongside smite then I suppose it is essentially nerfed soul split which is nice, but the healing should be buffed significantly imo (or just make soul split overhead)
* Glacies vow - bit confusing. How can the damage roll off enemy magic defence? Defence does not affect damage taken? Is this prayer just a very confusing way of saying ""more damage""?
* Umbra vow - also a bit confusing. Lowering enemy defence seems decent, but does it make shadow spells even more pointless? (and flames of zamorak)
* Fumus vow - again confusing. Your poison damage is lowered and you do a bit more damage if you are poisoned? So it's like Glacies vow but you need to be poisoned? Not sure about this one, and deliberately getting yourself poisoned to then do more damage is a bit of a weird mechanic.
* Ruinous grace - not sure this is appropriate for ruinous powers prayer book? And makes vile vigour spell pretty pointless.
* Ruinous smite - you smite yourself as much as you smite your opponent? Hate it. A stronger smite with a higher prayer drain is a much better design.
* Wrath - great. Retribution does ""up to 25% prayer level of damage"", wrath says it does 25% prayer level of damage. Does that mean that wrath always does exactly 25% of prayer level as damage? This makes sense I suppose as an upgrade to retribution, but may have just been worded incorrectly?
* Rejuvenation - also great. Rapid heal but better but much higher prayer drain. I'd like it to be buffed to 1hp every 15 seconds and have rapid heal be buffed to 1hp every 20 seconds personally, but it's good how it is.

&#x200B;

Overall seems pretty decent, but a few questionable and confusing parts.

The vows being just additional damage/healing on top of the regular offensive prayers on the book is a bit weird. Umbra not as much since it just lowers defence.  
Cruor giving additional passive healing is perhaps a bit overkill? Perhaps if it took the place of your overhead, and perhaps if it also smited, and perhaps if it was buffed a bit, it would be more interesting and balanced? And you could call it split soul or something? (OC do not steal)",1
617,jbhahiy,Good job on this I liked majority of the new ideas! can't wait to test them out -,1

621,jbin3ta,There doesn't seem to be any reason as to why you couldn't have both Deflect and Withstand prayers in the new Prayer book?,1
622,jbipyc7,reason is because players voted on not supercedeing the old book and have 2 sets of prots limits the design space for not superceding the whole book,1
623,jbiq2j0,"Absorb and dampen are sick, really like the idea of being able to choose between them situationally, it’s a good trade off for the extra power, please don’t change them to the new protection prayers, the book is plenty powerful without that change. 

New offensive prayers should clearly come from the post quest bosses, in a similar time/price to unlock as rigour and augury, otherwise chambers loses a lot of its place in the game. 

Also idrc about skilling prayers but was pretty hyped for ancient offering just cause fuck mining lol

Why would I not want to try 2 vastly different options?",12
627,jbgw2of,"just so all can understand. its 1% healing for damage dealt, aka its 1/25th the total healing of blood barrage. vastly lower healing, on top of increased prayer drain.

it will not save you from mistakes at boss's. only very slowly pull you back up.

i love the vows. they seem quite well balanced.",5

Is it something we can camp on slayer tasks for example?",17
629,jbe3zce,Cheers! Looking forward to trying these out in a beta soon.,5

635,jbe3xpk,"This reads correct to me, yeah!",30
636,jbehzu1,"Seems like it’s worthless then. If you are doing 10 dps (already really high -tbow level) 20% proc chance and 10% damage takes the dps increase to 0.2 dps, and this doesn’t include accuracy checks. Thralls are 0.66 dps, so this, at the very best, is 1/3 of thrall impact. If the monster has a high magic level (many bosses), the second accuracy check means this will be a 0.1 dps increase or less for most players.

Even with no second accuracy check, a 0.1-0.2 dps increase doesn’t seem worth the prayer drain.",17

I do hope the vows have fairly low prayer drain",1

To me, it was always important that the new prayers didn’t feel like they could just be added into the standard book similar to rigor/augury. These Vows are *clearly* related to Zaros/Ancient Prayerbook.

Honestly, I’d love if they added more Vows in the future. Would love to see what else they can cook up.",22
644,jbfbclk,"If I'm understanding it correctly, Fumus' Vow (poison one) actually seems crazy good when you can use it, to the point where I wonder if it will be used in speedruns against poison-susceptible bosses.

~~Getting pre-poisoned on Karamja tribesmen will add something like 40 damage over 15 hits.~~ Getting venom stacked up to a 20, converting it to a 20 poison by sipping a normal anti poison will add something like 70 damage over 20 hits. If it applies twice with a dds spec or d-knife spec, it'd add 17 damage on the first and 13 on the second which is great for rushing in pvp (blocked by antipoison, as a counter)

Even if you use it just to clear poison, it's great. If you're blowpiping when you get poisoned, you'll reduce a 6 damage poison to 2 damage before it ticks a single time (assuming no re-poison), while gaining 20+ extra damage over 15 seconds or so.

~~BP-ing shamans in CoX will add 6(!) damage a hit when poisoned~~, and you can clear it afterwards without even bringing an anti by bp-ing the next boss/scavs for 20s.

Edit: Shamans are immune to poison, as well as many other poisonous creatures. Prayer seems much more reasonable from that standpoint. 

Also, you can easily get an 'on-demand' maxed out poison stack by partially curing venom if you're willing to wait/eat. Starting with a max severity poison, +17 damage on an AGS+maul (or +36 damage on a claw+maul assuming 4 poison splats) will be...spicy...don't forget your serp.

Edit: numbers",6
645,jbfntxp,"I'm pretty sure it only activates on the next hit you do after you TAKE poison damage. I made the same mistake in understanding it you did, it would be busted AF if it activated every single attack you did while poisoned.",1

Assuming you have a 50% chance to hit the monster with all styles, you would essentially have a 25% chance for this to even hit at all on any given attack, assuming the attack passed the first roll for glacies to proc in the first place. Essentially it makes the dps boost somewhere around 1% instead of the 2% you'd intuitively think it to be, and considering lifesteal is almost always more useful than dps assuming equal values, glacies vow would almost never be used in this state.

Making it a guaranteed hit if you get the proc would be ideal i think. It already suffers from potential overkill dps loss compared to furor, no need to handicap it even more.",5

**Quickened Gathering:** Reduce ticks needed to gain resources. (Similar to 2tick/3tick manipulation methods, except it's draining your prayer points.) Maybe reduce EXP of gathered resources?

**Notable Harvests:** Want to make your farming runs a bit more efficient? The prayer automatically notes gathered resources from farming patches.

And this is crucially important. For one we're barely into this new polling charter *and you guys are already breaking it.* Second, on a pragmatic note, take a step back. This reward and the prayers in general are contentious. It's similar to Ancient Curses from back in the day, which are very controversial. It's a terrible idea when you're already in this situation to make a design decision that 80% of players oppose. 

With all due respect, please reconsider to do this properly. Have an in game poll where you say you're not confident about implementing skilling prayers, and you want to clarify what players want. See if they voted yes because they just want to see skilling prayers or if they want to see them specifically in this book. And if it's that they just overall want skilling prayers, then kill it from this book, and commit to adding a skilling prayer to the standard book with DT2 or from content later this year. If a considerable number of players voted yes because they thought it was the only way to get them in game, then any removal of skilling prayers should come with some promise of them in the near future.

And if the new skilling prayer book starts out small, that's okay, it can be expanded as time goes on. He'll, piety, rigour and augury were expansions that pushed the meta, and so will these new prayers. The same process can be done for the skilling prayers.

I think in the same way some of these prayers are just ""the same as Preserve.. but only combats"" its fine to not be always aligned with the ""trade-off"". Because the only ""skilling"" prayer to compare to is Preserve, which hardly counts.

So these are the first, and feels a bit weird that the community voted saying they want them, but based on some buried feedback (that without knowing, i'd imagine pales in comparison #'s wise to the poll) we just scrap the whole concept. I wish we could just.. see them? Give feedback? Rather than outright ""nvm we wont do that at all"".

> rather than trying to shoehorn them in or compromising the theming of the Ruinous Powers.

This has been a commonly brought up reddit argument. To that I say that Zaros lead the most powerful empire in Gielinor. And an empire needs effective resource acquisition and management to last, at all. So skilling prayers focusing on reosurce acquistion entirely fits the theme. It doesn't have to be dumbed down as much as ""war god so all combat"". Otherwise ditch protect item, smite, preserve, faster eating delay etc. These aren't ""combat"" so don't thematically fit if thats what we're going with.

Well aware its the survey results too. However I think an ingame poll gets across more eyeballs and voter count than a survey in an edit to an existing blog that was available for a few days. I, again, don't obviously know the numbers on this (so feel free to let me know far more people gave survey feedback) but I just think its a bit of a situational-bias formed by the ""angriest will be the most persistent"" compared to a regular game poll.

I guess my final point is: whats the harm in voting these into a beta? If they fail the poll to even enter the beta, no loss, the players decided. If they make it in and players decide ""these aren't fun we don't want these in the final version"", again, the players decide.

You can't eat every tick so it doesn't work like that. You still will need to wait 3 ticks before you can eat a karambwan which is why I used a 4 tick cycle in the example.

You can't eat karambwans every action and the way it would work is primarily for normies as they would just trade an alt and use share pot. But it would make some methods pretty bizarre and not in a good way.

Assuming you can lazy flick it, there's literally no excuse not to always lazy flick it when available. It's just free healing the game doesn't really need. That's the problem with balancing something like this.

Blood fury was bad because it was insanely expensive to use and there was a max hit tradeoff you had to justify. Now you use it literally anywhere you can justify the cost (which is basically all the content you'd consider using it in the first place, i.e. raids) as the healing is massively outperforming its max hit tradeoff.

The final vow is game changing lmfao, we now have a real way to drain defense outside of dwh hitting. you will ALWAYS use this vow if you weren't using bgs/dwh on the boss due to the spec not being worth it, as free 15% defense reduction is worth. AND you'll always have a backup for when bgs/dwh misses at content you already use those specs.

So it can be a large amount of bonus damage wherever you were getting poisoned anyway. General application, not really used as you mentioned.

Poison dealing bosses like Vorkath, Zulrah, Kril, KBD, Sire, Hydra, Scorpia, and Shamans might be enough to get a substancial boost without needing an antipoison. Might even be slightly useful at lesser poison dealing spots like Olm, but I'm not sure if rounding down the 10% severity would even do anything there. Maybe 1 extra damage.",1
862,jbfd146,"I'd agree on kril, but man. The thought of just gettin shit on by poison to hit for a guaranteed half of what you're getting hit just doesn't feel worth for long encounters.(take 16, deal 8 back)   

Maybe for the very last kill of a trip where you're all out of anti's it could come in clutch for a kill or maybe two if you're doing good on food, but I don't see any situation where it's the primary vow you're using.   

> Poison dealing bosses like Vorkath, Zulrah,

I'm not quite sure those would work until you degrade the inflicted venom into a poison. The rest would be interesting, I didn't even think of shamans-- I feel that they might be the best place to camp fumus's vow. Lightbearer+BP and I think you'd be able sustain for a while, and when you get too low, pop an anti and curor's vow back to full.",1
863,jbfcmbf,"reposting my above comment:

""So let me make sure I've got this right...1/10 poison severity rounded down added as guaranteed damage?

Zammy GWD poison hits 16s, so let's assume that a poison severity of 80. This means your next four attacks will be given +8, +7, +6, +5 damage respectively.

Including the new Melee Damage Prayer, Dragon claws max 92.

Would this mean claws now max 92 + 26 guaranteed damage? Let's also throw a granite maul in there (another +5 guaranteed damage from Fumus' Vow)

With dragon claws -> gmaul, you can now stack 92+52 damage while also dealing a guranteed +31 damage from the vow, totaling now 175 damage in two attacks while also curing your own poison.

Gets even more fun with Veng+Ice Barrage, of which Ice Barrage would also net your sequence another +4 guaranteed damage for a potential stack of upwards of 215 damage!""",1
864,jbfganz,"So it's an incentive to not pre-pot antidote for the poison inflicting encounters, or more realistically, it's a tool for rushing in pvp. Gotcha.   

(In case for pvp scenarios where stacking damage is important for securing kills, why settle on a 16 poison. Just wack yourself on an alt with a venom inflicting weapon. Chill till it's popping you for 20's, downgrade the venom to poison with an anti, and your victim is now getting dealt +10, +9, +8, +7, etc.)",1
865,jbfs16l,"Curors is bad, I agree. I think it’d still be balanced doubling the healing. Right now I’d be surprised if it’s even worth the prayer usage in most scenarios. 

But imo the others are pretty strong. 15% defense reduction will be extremely useful. The poison mechanic seems like it will be situationally very good. 

I suppose Glacies’ cow might not be that good either. 2% extra magic damage on your attacks seems strong, but the separate accuracy role will make it situationally useless and much lower than 2% in other situations, depending on the targets magic defense.

925,jbefhnl,"1% Lifesteal isn't anywhere close to busted. Blood Fury is 6%.

1% life steal is about ~45 hp on average in an entire solo Olm. I carry about 8 brews into Olm which is **608 hp** worth of supplies",6
926,jbf4svt,"An example. 6 man Nex, say 3 minute (180 secs) kill time. 4k hp nex, 3400 base, +500 P5, +100 from her healing. No walk unders or stalls, she attacks 75 times (4t attack speed).  P2 isnt effected by 90% Prot as it maxes 3-5 at max distance, 1-2 current Prot.  All other hits her max hit goes up by 2, so assume +2 damage per hit compared to standards.  25 hits per phase. But p3 you're spread, so 4.16 hits per player. 60/40 split pref melee in all other phases. So 2.5 melee hits per player per phase, 10 mage hits.  Meaning each player takes 4.16 mage hits p3, 7.5 melee his, and 30 mage hits that hurt you more due to 90% Prot.  So 41.66 hits, call it 42.  So for 90% Prot you take 84 more damage than current. But you hit for 666 damage, meaning you heal 6, down to 78.  So for the power of RP you need 4.8, call it 5, more doses of brew.  

Except you deal 7% more dps due to annihilate, meaning you still heal 6, but only take 80 more damage, so 4.6 doses.  With reflects? Nex takes 80*6 damage, 480, which is 12% of her total. So your team was dealing 22.2 to her to kill her in 3 mins.  22.2x1.07 is 23.77, but she only ""has"" 3520 hp now, meaning it takes 148 secs to kill her.  Shaving off 32 secs means she hits 13 ess times, which sure means she takes a bit less reflect (26), but you also take less damage. Of those 13 hits, you save 1.3 melee hits and 5.2 mage hits.  So now you take 13 less extra damage, down to 71, but still heal 5 because you hit 586 on her, down to 66, so for 1 extra brew you shave 32 secs (17% faster kills) off your kill time.  This is the issue of compounding extra damage with more healing.  Yes, ice vow would be better, but if people complain to make blood vow better, then were talking saving even more supplies, which then snowballs as more new equipment is added.  And Nex is the definition of a chip damage boss, the effect is even stronger at other bosses that aren't already brew fests.

The math prob gets wonky in there somewhere.  And you can reduce damage taken doing walk unders or stalls, minimizing extra damage taken.  If you reduce her to 60 attacks from 75 with walk unders you take that 71 down to 56, still healing 5. So now we're at needing 3 extra doses of brew to kill her 17% faster. Ice is so much better so now it's 2% heal, so now we only need 2 extra doses for the power, etc. The universal effects like weak soul split snowball heavily, and we don't need that in game.  A more interesting effect is better.",3
927,jbel84u,"You can also use protection prayers while doing it.  So yes, it isnt the 30% of all damage like original soul split was, I think.

Solo olm also isn't the height of PvM content.  It is skilled and it isn't low or mid tier PvM, but it isn't the case that you need end game gear and stats to do it.  And most are not taking 8 brews into any olm.  3/4ths of a brew that doesn't interrupt combat, or movement, or lower your offensive stats isn't a small buff.

Yes, 1% isn't ridiculously powerful. That being said, neither was blood fury on release.  This can be buffed due to complaint same as blood fury was, there isn't a good reason to add it.

Sang is like 8% healing, blood fury is 6%.  They also have drawbacks.  Fury is melee only and you lose dps.  Sang you lose dps and it's not just mage only, it's inbuilt sang spell only.  This prayer is a universal 1%.

And as we've seen time and time again, it takes forever, if ever, to fix something that was added broken.  Blood fury is already probably too strong, no changes since buff.  Bp took 6.5 years to nerf.  Zulrah drop table.  Etc.

All 3 of the other vows are either tangentially related to the normal effect, or are fairly unique.  Ice has nothing to do with freezing, Smoke is a unique idea for poison, Shadow is more related to shadows effect, but is def not attack.  A more unique, less potentially damaging option can be found for blood.

A bleed as an example.  Slightly higher damage/accuracy as your opponent gets lower hp.  Some stacking effect that increases with hits in succession.  There are other options that are far more interesting, and less potentially game breaking, than ""universally heal more, let's hope this doesn't become too much through power creep or player complaint.""",3

994,jbgc5gk,"3% is very significant, particularly when it stacks with things like blood fury.

This Vow seemingly will be in a spot of either too strong to be good for the game, or too weak to be worth using.  While currently it is very negligible, I worry about community uproar eventually buffing it to be too strong.

As it is, it's likely to be too weak, which I prefer.  That being said, I think the spot would be better served dodging the issue entirely by doing something more unique.

The ice vow doesn't really have anything to do with ice.  The shadow vow relates to shadow, but def instead of attack.  The smoke vow has an interesting, albeit probably limited interaction and fits with the poison theme.

Id rather see the blood vow do something unique and new.  Seemingly all blood related things in Osrs heal.  Sang, blood fury, blood spells.  Scythe skips this, but that's more due to it being a scythe than the blood charges.

Maybe something like a bleed? A DoT like poison, but ramps up as you do more damage.  Something like 5% of damage dealt to the boss is stored as a bleed, damage is dealt as 10% of the blood stack is used up, deals 1 damage per used stack every 5 ticks.  Avoids the poison issue of ""flinch to poison, wait till it dies or repeat"". You have to continually be in combat to stack it up, maybe the entire stack disappears after 10 ticks with no new stack.

Or other tie-ins of the opponent is bloodied/battered/etc.  The opponent is hurt, so moves slower, slightly more likely to miss, their max hit goes down, etc.  Maybe the opponent is heavily damaged, so we're slightly more likely to hit when the opponent is under half health.  Or under opponent half health our minimum hit is 1 instead of 0, if you pass the attack roll.  ""Bloodletting"" kind of effects rather than healing kind of effects.

Universal healing effects aren't good long term for the game. Admittedly 1% is low, but I think the team will get pressure to make the heal stronger, just like with blood fury.  Dodging the issue entirely seems better, and something more interesting/unique would be cool.",5

The prayer description seems to imply as long as severity>10, you're dealing extra damage each hit:

>While active, attacks consume 10% of your poison severity, to deal the same amount as bonus poison damage to an enemy.

If it is indeed every hit, I dont think it would be egregiously overpowered as its uses are quite niche (especially since many poisonous creatures are poison immune. My example of Shamans doesn't actually work as Shams are immune).

I've been pretty adamant in like every other reddit comment that I don't think this prayer book will be good at places where you need to stretch out prayer points (gwd/dks/inferno/high invo toa), so I'm well aware they intend for this prayer book to have higher drain rates. The majority of content in this game though you really wouldn't mind needing an extra 1-2 prayer potions for 7%+ more DPS.

We now have guaranteed protection prayers wherever that's benefitial and the trade-off is defence, which only matters in a few places with multiple attack styles, like GWD, Inferno (which you'd wanna be flicking correctly regardless, and the mini SS prayer is nuts for inferno anyway), and places like Olm or Zulrah where the style switch is unpredictable.

It just makes the prayerbook a *flat* upgrade and then just making it annoying as hell in random places where bosses swap styles at will or where minions exist.

It's easier to deal with the ""known"" consistent but reduced damage of the boss than it is to deal with beefed up auxilery damage that can randomly roll high.

Imagine fighting baba, taking the casual 20 through prayer from baba but having the ranged monkeys pelt you max hit over and over and over again because of the defense tradeoff. You'll be fine most of the time but those instances where enemies seem to just rail you from RNG increases.

It no longer becomes a ""controlled"" trade-off if you get what I mean. It's like ""every time you press this button you get $100, but 1/20 times you will get shot in the foot""",4

**Quickened Gathering:** Reduce ticks needed to gain resources. (Similar to 2tick/3tick manipulation methods, except it's draining your prayer points.) Maybe reduce EXP of gathered resources?

**Notable Harvests:** Want to make your farming runs a bit more efficient? The prayer automatically notes gathered resources from farming patches.

And this is crucially important. For one we're barely into this new polling charter *and you guys are already breaking it.* Second, on a pragmatic note, take a step back.

I think in the same way some of these prayers are just ""the same as Preserve.. but only combats"" its fine to not be always aligned with the ""trade-off"". Because the only ""skilling"" prayer to compare to is Preserve, which hardly counts.

So these are the first, and feels a bit weird that the community voted saying they want them, but based on some buried feedback (that without knowing, i'd imagine pales in comparison #'s wise to the poll) we just scrap the whole concept. I wish we could just.. see them? Give feedback? Rather than outright ""nvm we wont do that at all"".

> rather than trying to shoehorn them in or compromising the theming of the Ruinous Powers.

This has been a commonly brought up reddit argument. To that I say that Zaros lead the most powerful empire in Gielinor. And an empire needs effective resource acquisition and management to last, at all. So skilling prayers focusing on reosurce acquistion entirely fits the theme. It doesn't have to be dumbed down as much as ""war god so all combat"". Otherwise ditch protect item, smite, preserve, faster eating delay etc. These aren't ""combat"" so don't thematically fit if thats what we're going with.

Well aware its the survey results too. However I think an ingame poll gets across more eyeballs and voter count than a survey in an edit to an existing blog that was available for a few days. I, again, don't obviously know the numbers on this (so feel free to let me know far more people gave survey feedback) but I just think its a bit of a situational-bias formed by the ""angriest will be the most persistent"" compared to a regular game poll.

I guess my final point is: whats the harm in voting these into a beta? If they fail the poll to even enter the beta, no loss, the players decided. If they make it in and players decide ""these aren't fun we don't want these in the final version"", again, the players decide. But a total scrapping just feels like a bit of a ""whats the point in voting for what i want in polls if its just gonna change because later anyway"".",14

>Thematic sense is made entirely by the Devs

I agree to an extent. I wasn't stoked when the Venator boomerang idea was shot down for not thematically fitting what the devs wanted. That being said, some things are a much bigger stretch than others. If the playerbase submits feedback asking for a quest where Saradomin and Zamorak get together and hug it out then start living out the plot of Runescape Gods Exposed, I'm sure the devs could make sense of that, but it's certainly inconsistent with what we know of the lore so far. To me, I feel that nothing about the Zarosian Empire that we know screams ""these dudes were badass at cutting trees down"" or anything of the sort. Could it be written in? Sure, but if the rest of the prayerbook is themed around high risk high reward combat, surely everyone can acknowledge that a few afterthought skilling prayers that you'll toss on at motherlode mine or while barbarian fishing are about as conceptually far from high-risk-high-reward gameplay as we can possibly get.

>Afterall we are still keeping prayers like run energy from prayer points yeah? Where is the ""doesn't thematically fit"" outrage on that?

On the topic of what's easily justified in lore versus requiring the generation of whole new lore, let's write a single line of hypothetical exposition dialogue from DT2 that makes sense of this prayer:
""The Zarosian hordes, driven by fervor for their dark master, covered vast swaths of land in mere days when it should have taken weeks. Their marches were relentless.""
We can easily envision why this might have been relevant in the age of the god wars. That makes it thematically interesting!

>I don't think there is enough legit ideas to make a whole new prayer book for skilling

I'd take this a step further and say that none of the ideas we've seen for skilling prayers are all that legit. It's easy for the playerbase to say it wants something while doing zero legwork to consider whether it's actually an interesting idea.

>Don't circumvent a poll result.

For what it's worth, over 50 percent of the playerbase voted for combat and skilling prayers in balanced amounts. The devs struggled to put forth even three ideas for how prayers could impact skilling. So in a sense, we have already seen the poll result circumvented. 

Moreover, I think more people are coming to the realization that the idea of skillling prayers is much cooler that skilling prayers in practice. Insisting on having skilling prayers even as it becomes more apparent that they are neither interesting nor needed is like a four year old crying because his mother won't make him pizza-flavored ice cream—it's a great idea in his head, but the process of actually making it is pretty difficult and the result is going to be predictably disappointing.

Sorry for the long replies. I recognize these things are all my opinion, and you're entitled to disagree, but I do honestly think this is a case of the playerbase wanting a piece of content that is difficult to realize, and that will at best be mediocre and at worst be a complete waste of development time.",0

1346,jbfnfp9,"Pures are overpowered as it is.   If they weren't, they wouldn't exist.  Pkers need to have the foresight to realize that anything that makes pk-specific account builds better will have a detrimental effect on the popularity of pking.  
This is going to be the same thing as nerfing black d-hide.

When you reduce counterplay options for your opponents, you just decrease their interest in engaging with the activity at all.

So many people don't understand the economics of pking, and don't follow the effects thread to their logical conclusion.  Pures killed interest in pking.

If you cared about pking at all, you'd be screaming at the top of your lungs to nerf pures.  They are a result of a failure of the combat level calculation to reflect the combat abilities of low-defense accounts.  To be successful at pking now in wildy or pvp-worlds, you either have to have a nearly-maxed account or a pure.  Obviously those pking on maxed accounts tend to have more experience, and so it's a lose-lose situation for would-be pkers to engage with, and by the time that they get to that level, those who are most interested in PVP content in games have left the game for other games that scratch the itch, concentrating the mid-to-endgame playerbase to be incredibly biased towards PVM and other non-pvp content.  
TL;DR  Don't give pures access to new prayers, and NERF PURES INTO THE GROUND AT ALL COSTS.

I'm not quite sure those would work until you degrade the inflicted venom into a poison.

Niche, sure, but imo that should be the point of the vow's, they should have specific use cases rather than just ""turn this on and forget about it"". Reddit said the original proposal was ""boring"", imo this is exactly what a non-boring prayer functions like.",2

This is also true for raids where the damage is now multiplied per player, in addition to the newfound max hits and accuracy. It’s pretty disgustingly strong. You can also do the same with cave crawlers for half the poison severity but much more convenience.

1379,jbf4svt,"An example. 6 man Nex, say 3 minute (180 secs) kill time. 4k hp nex, 3400 base, +500 P5, +100 from her healing. No walk unders or stalls, she attacks 75 times (4t attack speed).  P2 isnt effected by 90% Prot as it maxes 3-5 at max distance, 1-2 current Prot.  All other hits her max hit goes up by 2, so assume +2 damage per hit compared to standards.  25 hits per phase. But p3 you're spread, so 4.16 hits per player. 60/40 split pref melee in all other phases. So 2.5 melee hits per player per phase, 10 mage hits.  Meaning each player takes 4.16 mage hits p3, 7.5 melee his, and 30 mage hits that hurt you more due to 90% Prot.  So 41.66 hits, call it 42.  So for 90% Prot you take 84 more damage than current. But you hit for 666 damage, meaning you heal 6, down to 78.  So for the power of RP you need 4.8, call it 5, more doses of brew.  

Except you deal 7% more dps due to annihilate, meaning you still heal 6, but only take 80 more damage, so 4.6 doses.  With reflects? Nex takes 80*6 damage, 480, which is 12% of her total. So your team was dealing 22.2 to her to kill her in 3 mins.  22.2x1.07 is 23.77, but she only ""has"" 3520 hp now, meaning it takes 148 secs to kill her.  Shaving off 32 secs means she hits 13 ess times, which sure means she takes a bit less reflect (26), but you also take less damage. Of those 13 hits, you save 1.3 melee hits and 5.2 mage hits.  So now you take 13 less extra damage, down to 71, but still heal 5 because you hit 586 on her, down to 66, so for 1 extra brew you shave 32 secs (17% faster kills) off your kill time.  This is the issue of compounding extra damage with more healing.  Yes, ice vow would be better, but if people complain to make blood vow better, then were talking saving even more supplies, which then snowballs as more new equipment is added.  And Nex is the definition of a chip damage boss, the effect is even stronger at other bosses that aren't already brew fests.

The math prob gets wonky in there somewhere.  And you can reduce damage taken doing walk unders or stalls, minimizing extra damage taken.  If you reduce her to 60 attacks from 75 with walk unders you take that 71 down to 56, still healing 5. So now we're at needing 3 extra doses of brew to kill her 17% faster. Ice is so much better so now it's 2% heal, so now we only need 2 extra doses for the power, etc. The universal effects like weak soul split snowball heavily, and we don't need that in game.  A more interesting effect is better.",3
1380,jbel84u,"You can also use protection prayers while doing it.  So yes, it isnt the 30% of all damage like original soul split was, I think.

Solo olm also isn't the height of PvM content.  It is skilled and it isn't low or mid tier PvM, but it isn't the case that you need end game gear and stats to do it.  And most are not taking 8 brews into any olm.  3/4ths of a brew that doesn't interrupt combat, or movement, or lower your offensive stats isn't a small buff.

Yes, 1% isn't ridiculously powerful. That being said, neither was blood fury on release.  This can be buffed due to complaint same as blood fury was, there isn't a good reason to add it.

Sang is like 8% healing, blood fury is 6%.  They also have drawbacks.  Fury is melee only and you lose dps.  Sang you lose dps and it's not just mage only, it's inbuilt sang spell only.  This prayer is a universal 1%.

And as we've seen time and time again, it takes forever, if ever, to fix something that was added broken.  Blood fury is already probably too strong, no changes since buff.  Bp took 6.5 years to nerf.  Zulrah drop table.  Etc.

All 3 of the other vows are either tangentially related to the normal effect, or are fairly unique.  Ice has nothing to do with freezing, Smoke is a unique idea for poison, Shadow is more related to shadows effect, but is def not attack.  A more unique, less potentially damaging option can be found for blood.

A bleed as an example.  Slightly higher damage/accuracy as your opponent gets lower hp.  Some stacking effect that increases with hits in succession.  There are other options that are far more interesting, and less potentially game breaking, than ""universally heal more, let's hope this doesn't become too much through power creep or player complaint.""",3

This Vow seemingly will be in a spot of either too strong to be good for the game, or too weak to be worth using.  While currently it is very negligible, I worry about community uproar eventually buffing it to be too strong.

As it is, it's likely to be too weak, which I prefer.  That being said, I think the spot would be better served dodging the issue entirely by doing something more unique.

The ice vow doesn't really have anything to do with ice.  The shadow vow relates to shadow, but def instead of attack.  The smoke vow has an interesting, albeit probably limited interaction and fits with the poison theme.

Id rather see the blood vow do something unique and new.  Seemingly all blood related things in Osrs heal.  Sang, blood fury, blood spells.  Scythe skips this, but that's more due to it being a scythe than the blood charges.

Maybe something like a bleed? A DoT like poison, but ramps up as you do more damage.  Something like 5% of damage dealt to the boss is stored as a bleed, damage is dealt as 10% of the blood stack is used up, deals 1 damage per used stack every 5 ticks.  Avoids the poison issue of ""flinch to poison, wait till it dies or repeat"". You have to continually be in combat to stack it up, maybe the entire stack disappears after 10 ticks with no new stack.

Or other tie-ins of the opponent is bloodied/battered/etc.  The opponent is hurt, so moves slower, slightly more likely to miss, their max hit goes down, etc.  Maybe the opponent is heavily damaged, so we're slightly more likely to hit when the opponent is under half health.  Or under opponent half health our minimum hit is 1 instead of 0, if you pass the attack roll.  ""Bloodletting"" kind of effects rather than healing kind of effects.

Universal healing effects aren't good long term for the game. Admittedly 1% is low, but I think the team will get pressure to make the heal stronger, just like with blood fury.  Dodging the issue entirely seems better, and something more interesting/unique would be cool.",5

I think both of those would reign in the ubiquitous use of the vow, as you're 100 percent correct this would just always be lazy flicked for the free HP.

1489,jbf3tv2,"Gotcha. Nothing saying they couldn’t make this an exception though!  Sometimes it’s fun to have some unique synergies between specific pieces of gear and mechanics like that.

That aside, the prayer as stated seems to proc of a successful hit. So while it wouldn’t roll the accuracy of the prayer twice, the proc happens on successful hit. Hitting more often would lead to more hits with the prayer.

In max melee, fang has a max hit of 58 and is the most accurate melee weapon in the game.  With the higher base accuracy to hit, it’s less rng on the front end. Assuming a ~75% accuracy rate with the 20% proc rate of the ice vow that’s around a 15% chance to get extra damage. Keep in mind this stacks with the other offensive piety equivalent.

If you max hit on that roll that’s a free 11 damage.  Sure it’s not much but these are also conservative values on the prayers.  

With a min hit of 8, and a max of 58 (assuming offensive prayer is on) that makes your average damage per hit ~33. So an average of an additional 6 damage every successful proc of the prayer. Over 12 swings a minute that’s 8 hits, and 1.6 procs of the prayer on average. With good rng this could be VERY impactful even at current numbers.  A lot of the challenges in this game are already dependent on good rng so that’s still in line with the rest of the game tbh.",-1

but after rereading I think it's only referring to the timing of ""your next attack after being inflicted"" as a reference point to the severity, which would exist even after your attack.

The prayer description seems to imply as long as severity>10, you're dealing extra damage each hit:

>While active, attacks consume 10% of your poison severity, to deal the same amount as bonus poison damage to an enemy.

If it is indeed every hit, I dont think it would be egregiously overpowered as its uses are quite niche (especially since many poisonous creatures are poison immune. My example of Shamans doesn't actually work as Shams are immune).

It just makes the prayerbook a *flat* upgrade and then just making it annoying as hell in random places where bosses swap styles at will or where minions exist.

It's easier to deal with the ""known"" consistent but reduced damage of the boss than it is to deal with beefed up auxilery damage that can randomly roll high.

Imagine fighting baba, taking the casual 20 through prayer from baba but having the ranged monkeys pelt you max hit over and over and over again because of the defense tradeoff. You'll be fine most of the time but those instances where enemies seem to just rail you from RNG increases.

It no longer becomes a ""controlled"" trade-off if you get what I mean. It's like ""every time you press this button you get $100, but 1/20 times you will get shot in the foot""",4

I agree to an extent. I wasn't stoked when the Venator boomerang idea was shot down for not thematically fitting what the devs wanted. That being said, some things are a much bigger stretch than others. If the playerbase submits feedback asking for a quest where Saradomin and Zamorak get together and hug it out then start living out the plot of Runescape Gods Exposed, I'm sure the devs could make sense of that, but it's certainly inconsistent with what we know of the lore so far. To me, I feel that nothing about the Zarosian Empire that we know screams ""these dudes were badass at cutting trees down"" or anything of the sort. Could it be written in? Sure, but if the rest of the prayerbook is themed around high risk high reward combat, surely everyone can acknowledge that a few afterthought skilling prayers that you'll toss on at motherlode mine or while barbarian fishing are about as conceptually far from high-risk-high-reward gameplay as we can possibly get.

>Afterall we are still keeping prayers like run energy from prayer points yeah? Where is the ""doesn't thematically fit"" outrage on that?

On the topic of what's easily justified in lore versus requiring the generation of whole new lore, let's write a single line of hypothetical exposition dialogue from DT2 that makes sense of this prayer:
""The Zarosian hordes, driven by fervor for their dark master, covered vast swaths of land in mere days when it should have taken weeks. Their marches were relentless.""
We can easily envision why this might have been relevant in the age of the god wars. That makes it thematically interesting!

>I don't think there is enough legit ideas to make a whole new prayer book for skilling

I'd take this a step further and say that none of the ideas we've seen for skilling prayers are all that legit. It's easy for the playerbase to say it wants something while doing zero legwork to consider whether it's actually an interesting idea.

>Don't circumvent a poll result.

For what it's worth, over 50 percent of the playerbase voted for combat and skilling prayers in balanced amounts. The devs struggled to put forth even three ideas for how prayers could impact skilling. So in a sense, we have already seen the poll result circumvented. 

Moreover, I think more people are coming to the realization that the idea of skillling prayers is much cooler that skilling prayers in practice. Insisting on having skilling prayers even as it becomes more apparent that they are neither interesting nor needed is like a four year old crying because his mother won't make him pizza-flavored ice cream—it's a great idea in his head, but the process of actually making it is pretty difficult and the result is going to be predictably disappointing.

Sorry for the long replies. I recognize these things are all my opinion, and you're entitled to disagree, but I do honestly think this is a case of the playerbase wanting a piece of content that is difficult to realize, and that will at best be mediocre and at worst be a complete waste of development time.",0

This is a lack of understanding of Zaros' history.

*""Little is known about what happened to Zaros after he left Freneskae. However it is known that he at some point arrived on the vampyre world of Vampyrium, where he became known as the Stranger from Afar, he taught the vampyres of culture and society, and changed them from hunting animals to more civilized beings.""*

*""Zaros arrived at Gielinor during the beginning of the Second Age, where he started building an empire together with his followers.""*

*""Over the course of several centuries, Zaros's empire grew to massive size, stretching more land than any kingdom ever established since, and the god ruled with force, aiming to put the entirety of Gielinor under his control. Its capital remained Senntisten, a large city in the south of the empire and the most advanced settlement of its time, possibly rivalling the elven city Prifddinas.""*

It **rivalled Prifddinas** as being the most advanced settlement. Does Priffdinas not invovle skilling? Hell most people point to Seren as a god option for a Skilling Book.

Its this complete lack of knowledge of the base lore to these gods which is why i'm sick of reading ""it doesn't fit"". Yes Zaros is dark energy and Seren is light energy. And Zaros preferred to rule through force. Thats represented in the combat prayers. Skilling still **exists** in a incredibly succesful massive empire ruled by a god who taught culture and society, civilised vampyres, build the most sophisticated settlement of its time etc. This doesn't happen by ""swing sword harder"".

> On the topic of what's easily justified in lore versus requiring the generation of whole new lore, let's write a single line of hypothetical exposition dialogue from DT2 that makes sense of this prayer: ""The Zarosian hordes, driven by fervor for their dark master, covered vast swaths of land in mere days when it should have taken weeks.

I agree this prayer can be included btw. I'm simply using it to point out the hypocrisy in the logic of ""skilling prayers can't thematically fit a war god like Zaros"". We gotta be consistent if we're gonna be misinformed. But yes, i want this prayer, its a good idea, and lore can easily explain its usage.

> I'd take this a step further and say that none of the ideas we've seen for skilling prayers are all that legit. It's easy for the playerbase to say it wants something while doing zero legwork to consider whether it's actually an interesting idea.

I've seen plenty. The easy low hanging fruit is just toning down League relics and making them a prayer. Chance for double harvest, chance to auto bank, chance to auto destroy, boosts become static like Divines, farming harvest is auto-noted, increased farming yield prayers etc. The list goes on.

You know what these compare to with combats? ""Do 20% more damage and be 20% more accurate"". Theres no gameplay there, but its a great prayer. Because prayers are *simple buffs*.

> For what it's worth, over 50 percent of the playerbase voted for combat and skilling prayers in balanced amounts. The devs struggled to put forth even three ideas for how prayers could impact skilling. So in a sense, we have already seen the poll result circumvented.

Yes, this is what im complainng about. Lack of effort towards the poll result into then a ""well nobody liked it so we're ditching it"". Its disingenous.

> Moreover, I think more people are coming to the realization that the idea of skillling prayers is much cooler that skilling prayers in practice.

I really don't think this is true. The people saying this rhetoric are often ones who didn't want them in the first place, or who seriously overvalue what prayers do. Combat prayers are just different versions of ""do more damage"" or ""take less damage"". They have interesting uses due to the content they are used in, not because they themselves are inherently good gameplay loops.

> Sorry for the long replies. I recognize these things are all my opinion, and you're entitled to disagree, but I do honestly think this is a case of the playerbase wanting a piece of content that is difficult to realize, and that will at best be mediocre and at worst be a complete waste of development time.

Don't be sorry for long replies. I enjoy discussing these things and appreciate you taking the time to formulate your opinion. Disagreeing with things is a part of good covnersation and gets a better result in the end. I'll always say, sorry if i'm blunt. Being on the spectrum makes it hard for me to.. not be an ass sometimes ;) 

I think these ideas need more time in the oven to be realised. I guess thats what upset me the most. We got repeated efforts of ""GUYS THIS IS JUST TO PUT THEM IN BETA, TRY THEM OUT AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK!!!"" but with skilling prayers? ""Yeh it seems people dont want it, idea ditched"". Even the super unpopular ""this isn't useful anywhere"" combat prayers are still getting polled.",1

Now that anyone can get better prayers, they're pretty much dead. You're basically getting 6.25 combat levels (from 45 to 70 def) for a bit more tankiness and maybe 1 max hit from gear.

Pures, on the other hand, will be considerably stronger relative to their combat level. They will be able to access stronger prayers than piety for only ~5.3 combat levels, which is much lower than the equivalent account at 45 def, 53 pray (6 combat levels).

Maybe I'm rambling at this point but I think pures will become far stronger for their cb, and meds will become pointless.

Personally I think a defense requirement should be polled, though it's probably irrelevant because most people don't care about pvp.",1

It just creates confusion.",2
1684,jbfnfp9,"Pures are overpowered as it is.   If they weren't, they wouldn't exist.  Pkers need to have the foresight to realize that anything that makes pk-specific account builds better will have a detrimental effect on the popularity of pking.  
This is going to be the same thing as nerfing black d-hide.

When you reduce counterplay options for your opponents, you just decrease their interest in engaging with the activity at all.

So many people don't understand the economics of pking, and don't follow the effects thread to their logical conclusion.  Pures killed interest in pking.

If you cared about pking at all, you'd be screaming at the top of your lungs to nerf pures.  They are a result of a failure of the combat level calculation to reflect the combat abilities of low-defense accounts.  To be successful at pking now in wildy or pvp-worlds, you either have to have a nearly-maxed account or a pure.  Obviously those pking on maxed accounts tend to have more experience, and so it's a lose-lose situation for would-be pkers to engage with, and by the time that they get to that level, those who are most interested in PVP content in games have left the game for other games that scratch the itch, concentrating the mid-to-endgame playerbase to be incredibly biased towards PVM and other non-pvp content.  
TL;DR  Don't give pures access to new prayers, and NERF PURES INTO THE GROUND AT ALL COSTS.

This is also true for raids where the damage is now multiplied per player, in addition to the newfound max hits and accuracy. It’s pretty disgustingly strong. You can also do the same with cave crawlers for half the poison severity but much more convenience.

If we get any form of 100% protection prayers then you're not taking any meaningful extra damage in almost any scenario, and the additional damage output alone is insane, so easily enough to justify any extra you do take.

Perfect example being Ely/Div being ""BiS"" pre-eoc Nex.  They never were, eagle eye kite was a thing.  A lot of people just camped SS, even in high combat pvm clans.  Good players did then, just like good players flick now.  Plenty didn't, just like plenty dont flick now.

I never suggested making grinds faster, just deterministic. To me, a guaranteed unlock after a set amount of kills (be it 50 or 256) is actually more of a ""grind"" than rng anyway. You see someone with an infernal cape, you know that they've actually completed the inferno, they didn't roll a lucky cape drop on wave one. You see someone with a cox pet though, they could have done literally one raid.

To me, rng actually undermines the ""grind"" - some people won't actually have to grind for it at all, while others actually did a huge grind, but don't have anything to show for it. To me a grind involves slow progress towards a defined end, while rng ""grinds"" are really lootboxes/lotteries.

1750,jbfcmqy,"Replies like yours are why everyone is constantly at each other's throats. Here's lets try it differently without belittling each other:


I think that most advanced players would prefer +12 melee strength over a regen bracelet - hence why we don't see the regen bracelet used anywhere serious today. To that end, it's incredibly unlikely that comparing this prayer to a regen bracelet is fair or even intended. Furthermore, this healing is not type specific and can be considered ""free"" in many scenarios that a regen bracelet would be costly (such as with gear swaps). Nobody is going to start or stop using bracelets because of this prayer - mainly because it's already not used.",4

1752,jbfav2w,"It’s definitely an overall upgrade but you’re going to be more likely to take a range when starting the waves, so it isn’t strictly better. Also if you can’t 1tick flick prot prayers on this book that’s relevant as well. 

If it is just an upgrade everywhere except for niche places that’s probably okay. It’s complicated, rewards giving some stuff actual thought with the vows, and rewards flicking gambit with overheads to ensure there’s still a bit of skill intensity that flicking offered. I thoroughly love the design the old school team came up with here. Id like to see this in a beta because the numbers could possibly use adjusting, but it does seem good.",2

1756,jbggtko,Heal when you kill an enemy and drain prayer sounds like a good alternative. It's essentially a mini keris like you said and means you can opt to flick it on at the end of a kill and sacrifice prayer to gain some HP back. I like that.,2
1757,jbfmzte,"Healing in game tends to floor at 1 hp for hits where the heal would truncate to 0. It could be different for this prayer, in which case that would certainly nerf it quite a bit since 0-9 is a likely hit with something like a blowpipe",2

1769,jbf3tv2,"Gotcha. Nothing saying they couldn’t make this an exception though!  Sometimes it’s fun to have some unique synergies between specific pieces of gear and mechanics like that.

That aside, the prayer as stated seems to proc of a successful hit. So while it wouldn’t roll the accuracy of the prayer twice, the proc happens on successful hit. Hitting more often would lead to more hits with the prayer.

In max melee, fang has a max hit of 58 and is the most accurate melee weapon in the game.  With the higher base accuracy to hit, it’s less rng on the front end. Assuming a ~75% accuracy rate with the 20% proc rate of the ice vow that’s around a 15% chance to get extra damage. Keep in mind this stacks with the other offensive piety equivalent.

If you max hit on that roll that’s a free 11 damage.  Sure it’s not much but these are also conservative values on the prayers.  

With a min hit of 8, and a max of 58 (assuming offensive prayer is on) that makes your average damage per hit ~33. So an average of an additional 6 damage every successful proc of the prayer. Over 12 swings a minute that’s 8 hits, and 1.6 procs of the prayer on average. With good rng this could be VERY impactful even at current numbers.  A lot of the challenges in this game are already dependent on good rng so that’s still in line with the rest of the game tbh.",-1
1770,jbfbh8s,"I’m not against the idea of the prayer in the first place. However, the ruinous prayers version of piety provides a good 20% increase (or more, I haven’t looked at the dps calculator) in dps. This provides, at best, a 2% increase in dps. Unless they make the prayer drain 10x slower it won’t really be useful except in niche scenarios (speedrunners looking for PB’s on kill times?). In the same token, this does stack with other prayers, so it makes it rather hard to balance on how powerful it should be.",5

But correct me if I am wrong but the vesp stomp maxes 8 in cm solos. Meaning if you were on 10 HP the lowest HP you can have without procing, the heal is 14 with vindication, giving you 24 hp for that proc, making the only way you could die is if it hit all 8s. So you just walk under for 1 tick to get a proc and then repeat like normal. Again I don't see how vesp is fucked.

I think there are interesting ways to balance it via prayer drain, like only draining prayer when the effect procs (or to get fancy with it, prayer drain = the square root of the # of enemies hit to incentivize using it for aoe). This would make it more viable for longer combat sessions instead of just blasting out as much DPS as possible, which IMO feels a lot better gameplay-wise than having a mechanic that essentially wastes prayer points",3

1867,jbhgwze,"> To me, I feel that nothing about the Zarosian Empire that we know screams ""these dudes were badass at cutting trees down"" or anything of the sort. Could it be written in? Sure, but if the rest of the prayerbook is themed around high risk high reward combat, surely everyone can acknowledge that a few afterthought skilling prayers that you'll toss on at motherlode mine or while barbarian fishing are about as conceptually far from high-risk-high-reward gameplay as we can possibly get.

This is a lack of understanding of Zaros' history.

*""Little is known about what happened to Zaros after he left Freneskae. However it is known that he at some point arrived on the vampyre world of Vampyrium, where he became known as the Stranger from Afar, he taught the vampyres of culture and society, and changed them from hunting animals to more civilized beings.""*

*""Zaros arrived at Gielinor during the beginning of the Second Age, where he started building an empire together with his followers.""*

*""Over the course of several centuries, Zaros's empire grew to massive size, stretching more land than any kingdom ever established since, and the god ruled with force, aiming to put the entirety of Gielinor under his control. Its capital remained Senntisten, a large city in the south of the empire and the most advanced settlement of its time, possibly rivalling the elven city Prifddinas.""*

It **rivalled Prifddinas** as being the most advanced settlement. Does Priffdinas not invovle skilling? Hell most people point to Seren as a god option for a Skilling Book.

Its this complete lack of knowledge of the base lore to these gods which is why i'm sick of reading ""it doesn't fit"". Yes Zaros is dark energy and Seren is light energy. And Zaros preferred to rule through force. Thats represented in the combat prayers. Skilling still **exists** in a incredibly succesful massive empire ruled by a god who taught culture and society, civilised vampyres, build the most sophisticated settlement of its time etc. This doesn't happen by ""swing sword harder"".

> On the topic of what's easily justified in lore versus requiring the generation of whole new lore, let's write a single line of hypothetical exposition dialogue from DT2 that makes sense of this prayer: ""The Zarosian hordes, driven by fervor for their dark master, covered vast swaths of land in mere days when it should have taken weeks. Their marches were relentless."" We can easily envision why this might have been relevant in the age of the god wars. That makes it thematically interesting!

I agree this prayer can be included btw. I'm simply using it to point out the hypocrisy in the logic of ""skilling prayers can't thematically fit a war god like Zaros"". We gotta be consistent if we're gonna be misinformed. But yes, i want this prayer, its a good idea, and lore can easily explain its usage.

> I'd take this a step further and say that none of the ideas we've seen for skilling prayers are all that legit. It's easy for the playerbase to say it wants something while doing zero legwork to consider whether it's actually an interesting idea.

I've seen plenty. The easy low hanging fruit is just toning down League relics and making them a prayer. Chance for double harvest, chance to auto bank, chance to auto destroy, boosts become static like Divines, farming harvest is auto-noted, increased farming yield prayers etc. The list goes on.

You know what these compare to with combats? ""Do 20% more damage and be 20% more accurate"". Theres no gameplay there, but its a great prayer. Because prayers are *simple buffs*.

> For what it's worth, over 50 percent of the playerbase voted for combat and skilling prayers in balanced amounts. The devs struggled to put forth even three ideas for how prayers could impact skilling. So in a sense, we have already seen the poll result circumvented.

Yes, this is what im complainng about. Lack of effort towards the poll result into then a ""well nobody liked it so we're ditching it"". Its disingenous.

> Moreover, I think more people are coming to the realization that the idea of skillling prayers is much cooler that skilling prayers in practice.

I really don't think this is true. The people saying this rhetoric are often ones who didn't want them in the first place, or who seriously overvalue what prayers do. Combat prayers are just different versions of ""do more damage"" or ""take less damage"". They have interesting uses due to the content they are used in, not because they themselves are inherently good gameplay loops.

> Sorry for the long replies. I recognize these things are all my opinion, and you're entitled to disagree, but I do honestly think this is a case of the playerbase wanting a piece of content that is difficult to realize, and that will at best be mediocre and at worst be a complete waste of development time.

Don't be sorry for long replies. I enjoy discussing these things and appreciate you taking the time to formulate your opinion. Disagreeing with things is a part of good covnersation and gets a better result in the end. I'll always say, sorry if i'm blunt. Being on the spectrum makes it hard for me to.. not be an ass sometimes ;) 

I think these ideas need more time in the oven to be realised. I guess thats what upset me the most. We got repeated efforts of ""GUYS THIS IS JUST TO PUT THEM IN BETA, TRY THEM OUT AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK!!!"" but with skilling prayers? ""Yeh it seems people dont want it, idea ditched"". Even the super unpopular ""this isn't useful anywhere"" combat prayers are still getting polled.",1
1868,jbho5om,"One more reply on this, and a smaller one at that. I won't address all of your points, but having read your arguments I feel comfortable stating the following.

I understand that an empire existed, but I still don't think building an empire long ago in lore in and of itself is enough to ground half a book's worth of skilling prayers. I'm aware of the lore, and it doesn't change my view. The idea that skilling, civilization, culture, etc. all may have happened in a civilization doesn't usurp that most of what we see embodied in the values of that civilization involve control through force. Their spellbook is the only one of the four we have available that is as focused and streamlined, and is notably the only book of the four to have no skilling-related spells. Surely at the very least you can agree it's hardly a natural fit, and it does require some substantial legwork to justify compared to a full-on combat prayer book.

You'll find no disagreement from me that the current combat proposals aren't super exciting. I feel like they need to lean a bit more into the high risk high reward elements, and this most recent revision is a bit better, but still not quite what I'd hoped.

I like the leagues relic idea, but it's a little at odds with the idea you presented earlier that there aren't enough good ideas for a full skilling prayer book, given that there's really no shortage of skilling relics. Moreover, I think it's very hard in practice to make a skilling book full of league relics to walk the line between dead content and overpowered. A 5% chance to bank a resource you collect probably isn't worth it, while a 50% chance is a bit high.

I tend to agree that these ideas need more time in the oven, but that's why I'd prefer skilling prayers to be part of a different prayer expansion, maybe in tandem with the new skill as a massive skilling expansion package. IMO, more than anything combat related, a good set of skilling prayers should substantially change the meta around skilling, and the time of release of a new skill might be a good time for that.",0

Even without the survey, that poll question is incomplete, and I would argue invalid, at least for what you're pushing for.

The survey is just additional context to try and clarify what players actually wanted based on the poll question.

Pures, on the other hand, will be considerably stronger relative to their combat level. They will be able to access stronger prayers than piety for only ~5.3 combat levels, which is much lower than the equivalent account at 45 def, 53 pray (6 combat levels).

Maybe I'm rambling at this point but I think pures will become far stronger for their cb, and meds will become pointless.

I never suggested making grinds faster, just deterministic. To me, a guaranteed unlock after a set amount of kills (be it 50 or 256) is actually more of a ""grind"" than rng anyway.

You see someone with a cox pet though, they could have done literally one raid.

To me, rng actually undermines the ""grind"" - some people won't actually have to grind for it at all, while others actually did a huge grind, but don't have anything to show for it. To me a grind involves slow progress towards a defined end, while rng ""grinds"" are really lootboxes/lotteries.

Then there are fights or phases within fights where you don't need a protection prayer anyway, like running head at olm in teams, or 3:0 mage running, safespotted shamans and ice demon, guardians, Kephri before agile scarabs, akkha if someone is butterflying, p1 warden entirely and p3 warden before the first phantom spawns, Xarpus, Verzik p2, Muspah during its melee phase, and Vetion/Calvar'ion when dogs aren't up. Even giant mole if ranging. There's probably more that I can't think of right now. 

Sure, the prayer does have a high skill ceiling in terms of extracting the most benefit out of it. But I'd also argue it has a really low skill floor for getting a decent amount of benefit, which is perfect imo. I can't see myself switching on gambit between protection prayers for every hit on every boss (unless I'm really desperate to finish of the boss), but the list I just mentioned already spices up quite a few encounters. And I don't really think the skill ceiling needs to be arbitrarily lower than it could be.",3

Never tried tob so i cant comment on it, but i dont see myself bringing ruinous prayerbook to inferno at all. Chip damage in a supply management challenge? No thanks. I think its balanced.",4
1937,jbedlrh,"Inferno, being such a sustainment challenge, is really the outlier among endgame content. It would be great for the rest of it. The DPS will be huge at ToB, CoX, ToA, etc.

I guess you're right about the prayer itself not being broken, but throwing a few random free heals on top of a prayerbook that is already much better than the previous one is.

I think that most advanced players would prefer +12 melee strength over a regen bracelet - hence why we don't see the regen bracelet used anywhere serious today. To that end, it's incredibly unlikely that comparing this prayer to a regen bracelet is fair or even intended. Furthermore, this healing is not type specific and can be considered ""free"" in many scenarios that a regen bracelet would be costly (such as with gear swaps).

If it is just an upgrade everywhere except for niche places that’s probably okay. It’s complicated, rewards giving some stuff actual thought with the vows, and rewards flicking gambit with overheads to ensure there’s still a bit of skill intensity that flicking offered.

Unless they make the prayer drain 10x slower it won’t really be useful except in niche scenarios (speedrunners looking for PB’s on kill times?).

The main thing I’m trying to convey positively about these vow prayers is that they are exactly the thematic difference we need from the base prayer book. Make the effects wild and wacky, but get them to the beta and make sure they aren’t over or under tuned. And if one or two of them ends up being niche where it’s only good for speed runners on x melee boss or whatever I think that’s even fine. We have a lot of things like that in the game already.

1955,jbeu0nf,"Fair enough then, I just meant in terms you can just leech off your teammates and aren't fucked for it.   


But correct me if I am wrong but the vesp stomp maxes 8 in cm solos. Meaning if you were on 10 HP the lowest HP you can have without procing, the heal is 14 with vindication, giving you 24 hp for that proc, making the only way you could die is if it hit all 8s. So you just walk under for 1 tick to get a proc and then repeat like normal. Again I don't see how vesp is fucked.  


I play solo so I don't know if the stomp damage scales with raid size but if it's still the same then there is legit no issues in teams either.",-9
1956,jbf5cu7,"The problem with Vesp is a bit of a sliding scale, I think.

Vesp hits you 3 times for 2-8 when you go for an attack on the portal. So any time a redemption-like effect heals for <23 you risk coming out at 8 or less hp, forcing a brew sip or risking death if not paying attention. The lower the heal, the more likely you'll need to brew.

For example, if redemption heals you 23, you'd have to take exactly 7 8s in a row to req a brew:

10 > (2 heal to 25) > 17 > 9 > out > (1 heal to 24) > 16 > 8 > out > dead

but if redemption heals you, say, 17, you only need 27 damage over 4 hits instead, which is something like 5 orders of magnitude more likely, and would likely happen close to once per Vesp:

10 > (2 heal to 19) > 11 > 3 > out > dead, with 5 damage to spare

Healing 14 or less becomes even more risky, as you can be killed through a heal proc in a single attack at a 1/343 chance:

10 > (2 heal to 16) > 8 > dead

Not to mention that at that point brews are a more effective healing per slot than restore. You would likely not even bother and just brew  the pain away, given the amount of brewing you'd need to do already.

IMO it should heal at least 19 at 99 prayer, forcing you to brew to stay alive maybe once every 3-5 raids with high-tier gear.",7

Like, imagine if the Arceuus spellbook rework had a stronger ice barrage, venge on a shorter cool down and thralls.

2016,jbho5om,"One more reply on this, and a smaller one at that. I won't address all of your points, but having read your arguments I feel comfortable stating the following.

I understand that an empire existed, but I still don't think building an empire long ago in lore in and of itself is enough to ground half a book's worth of skilling prayers. I'm aware of the lore, and it doesn't change my view. The idea that skilling, civilization, culture, etc. all may have happened in a civilization doesn't usurp that most of what we see embodied in the values of that civilization involve control through force. Their spellbook is the only one of the four we have available that is as focused and streamlined, and is notably the only book of the four to have no skilling-related spells. Surely at the very least you can agree it's hardly a natural fit, and it does require some substantial legwork to justify compared to a full-on combat prayer book.

You'll find no disagreement from me that the current combat proposals aren't super exciting. I feel like they need to lean a bit more into the high risk high reward elements, and this most recent revision is a bit better, but still not quite what I'd hoped.

I like the leagues relic idea, but it's a little at odds with the idea you presented earlier that there aren't enough good ideas for a full skilling prayer book, given that there's really no shortage of skilling relics. Moreover, I think it's very hard in practice to make a skilling book full of league relics to walk the line between dead content and overpowered. A 5% chance to bank a resource you collect probably isn't worth it, while a 50% chance is a bit high.

I tend to agree that these ideas need more time in the oven, but that's why I'd prefer skilling prayers to be part of a different prayer expansion, maybe in tandem with the new skill as a massive skilling expansion package. IMO, more than anything combat related, a good set of skilling prayers should substantially change the meta around skilling, and the time of release of a new skill might be a good time for that.",0
2017,jbia6xm,"I can't really get past the fact we're still hung up on ""war god so has to be combat"". I think you need to step past that as an excuse for these choices because it just does not hold up against the lore we already have, let alone the fact that the Devs control what lore exists. So it can easily be explained.

I don't think there's as many skilling league relics as you think, especially when we talk about how some of them might be wayyyyy too strong to exist.

I also despise the idea of a separate prayer book for one function. It just adds a tedium of changing books every time you change activity. Doing pvm? Onto the ruinous powers. Doing skilling? Time to always swap to this specific book.

It just adds an unnecessary step. Just add prayers to the existing book(s). We don't have 20 skilling prayer ideas that need to exist. Refine the options down to a solid 6-8 and split them across the books with the ""downside but upside"" themed ones being in this new book and just the flat ""gather more"" being in the original book.

And past all this, don't **completely abandon** the polled content without polling if we really still want it (and where we want it from). A survey with hidden data is just a slimey new way for Devs to shoehorn their own preferences over players.",1

Even without the survey, that poll question is incomplete, and I would argue invalid, at least for what you're pushing for.

The survey is just additional context to try and clarify what players actually wanted based on the poll question. 

At any rate, separating the two makes it easier to design both properly, and if they meet the original spec of having reasons to swap prayer book, it ultimately won't matter which book the skilling prayers end up on. The only thing that changes is when they arrive.",-5

[The entire blog post](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/desert-treasure-ii---the-fallen-empire-rewards-greenlight-blog?oldschool=1) that had this question in it was about the rewards for Desert Treasure 2. I would say that the average person looking at this poll would assume that the prayer distribution that was offered in said poll would be part of the Prayer Book reward from DS2. The option that was chosen by a fairly large margin was a roughly even split of skilling and combat prayers.

If Jagex's original intention was trying to poll the general idea of skilling prayers then at best this was communicated extremely poorly. I do not believe this was the case though. If they are like ""We hear you and we will implement skilling prayers, but just not for DS2 rewards."" then its should be communicated in a blog post very quickly with at least some idea for implementation. This is a pretty large renege on what was polled.",0

The problem is, Zarosian prayers are super contentious. We see all the arguments. It needs every vote it can get to pass. Making sure to not piss off any players is in their best interest.

There is a bit more nuance than that my friend.

Even if there are benefits that can be gained by any account pvp build due to this update, and pvp involves fighting other players, then they have access to the same things that you do, buffing both sides of the fight equally.  That being said, it's reasonable to assume that the benefit will NOT be felt equally by all, and any net gain for a particular build (especially in pvp) is an implicit loss by the alternatives.

Any update that increases the power of pures, ESPECIALLY when locked behind grandmaster quest completion or inordinately-high offensive stats is nothing but cancer for the pking community.",-2

So to quote you ""any net gain for a particular build (especially in pvp) is an implicit loss by the alternatives."" If you dont give it to pures aswell, you will only icrease the gap between pures and other builds which soon means pures are extinct pvp build. 

There are currently more pures that participate in pvm or skilling than pures that actively participate in 1v1 pvp. (Which is probably also news to you).

Sure the turbonerds that will be able to, and likely can be bothered to switch to gambit on every tick they're attacking, which means they get the most benefit from that prayer. However, even your average joe can get a lot of utility out of it. Anyone can slap it on for the bonus accuracy to land a hammer or a bgs at the start of a fight without really any risk. 

Then there are fights or phases within fights where you don't need a protection prayer anyway, like running head at olm in teams, or 3:0 mage running, safespotted shamans and ice demon, guardians, Kephri before agile scarabs, akkha if someone is butterflying, p1 warden entirely and p3 warden before the first phantom spawns, Xarpus, Verzik p2, Muspah during its melee phase, and Vetion/Calvar'ion when dogs aren't up. Even giant mole if ranging. There's probably more that I can't think of right now. 

Sure, the prayer does have a high skill ceiling in terms of extracting the most benefit out of it. But I'd also argue it has a really low skill floor for getting a decent amount of benefit, which is perfect imo. I can't see myself switching on gambit between protection prayers for every hit on every boss (unless I'm really desperate to finish of the boss), but the list I just mentioned already spices up quite a few encounters.

And if one or two of them ends up being niche where it’s only good for speed runners on x melee boss or whatever I think that’s even fine. We have a lot of things like that in the game already.

2072,jbf5cu7,"The problem with Vesp is a bit of a sliding scale, I think.

Vesp hits you 3 times for 2-8 when you go for an attack on the portal. So any time a redemption-like effect heals for <23 you risk coming out at 8 or less hp, forcing a brew sip or risking death if not paying attention. The lower the heal, the more likely you'll need to brew.

For example, if redemption heals you 23, you'd have to take exactly 7 8s in a row to req a brew:

10 > (2 heal to 25) > 17 > 9 > out > (1 heal to 24) > 16 > 8 > out > dead

but if redemption heals you, say, 17, you only need 27 damage over 4 hits instead, which is something like 5 orders of magnitude more likely, and would likely happen close to once per Vesp:

10 > (2 heal to 19) > 11 > 3 > out > dead, with 5 damage to spare

Healing 14 or less becomes even more risky, as you can be killed through a heal proc in a single attack at a 1/343 chance:

10 > (2 heal to 16) > 8 > dead

Not to mention that at that point brews are a more effective healing per slot than restore. You would likely not even bother and just brew  the pain away, given the amount of brewing you'd need to do already.

IMO it should heal at least 19 at 99 prayer, forcing you to brew to stay alive maybe once every 3-5 raids with high-tier gear.",7
2073,jbh2ytt,"Thanks for an actual response.

You use the prayer enhance, so you aren't actually drinking restores so regen/slot isn't that important.

In the case of being 10hp you can step under to get a proc and immediately run out to go heal up and then wait for the prayer to regen. After that you could still be put to low hp and at that point you can consider using a brew. You could also sac an inventory spot for a dwarven rock cake and proc vindication outside of vesp and just wait 6 more ticks. It does waste time waiting for extra prayer regen/use supplies when using brew but that brings me back to opportunity cost.",1

I've tried to highlight points on which we could find common ground but it seems like you've been content to belittle my knowledge and opinions rather than meaningfully engaging with them.

[The entire blog post](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/desert-treasure-ii---the-fallen-empire-rewards-greenlight-blog?oldschool=1) that had this question in it was about the rewards for Desert Treasure 2. I would say that the average person looking at this poll would assume that the prayer distribution that was offered in said poll would be part of the Prayer Book reward from DS2. The option that was chosen by a fairly large margin was a roughly even split of skilling and combat prayers.

If Jagex's original intention was trying to poll the general idea of skilling prayers then at best this was communicated extremely poorly. I do not believe this was the case though. If they are like ""We hear you and we will implement skilling prayers, but just not for DS2 rewards."" then its should be communicated in a blog post very quickly with at least some idea for implementation. This is a pretty large renege on what was polled.",0

Yes, that is what the question asked. However it leaves no room for alternative avenues. There is no option for any choice of how to get skilling prayers so *of course* people who want them voted yes. Doesn't mean they care which book they're in.

No.  I'm familiar with many pures that spend most of their time engaging in non-pvp content, but that just goes to show how dead pking is, how broken pures are already, and fails to address the elephant in the room regarding a player who chose to limit themselves in a certain way should somehow be insulated against updates which increase the amount of content from which they are excluding themselves from.

I really don't see Lunars used all that often for PvM personally, and the only reason to use the Arceus spellbook for PvM is for Thralls (which is a good reason, don't get me wrong).

I dont get the point of this paragraph. I agree ancients is used. Some of your examples are places it is *worse* to use at though. And arceuss has death charge, thralls, corruption (though no real place of use for that yet).

DK's, ToB, Inferno, GWD, PvP.

Arceuss is *easily* the most used alternate spellbook. Its not even close. Anywhere you don't **require** a spell from a different spellbook, arceus is BiS. Its also used for nothing outside of combat, whereas all other books are.

See the downside of having a combat only book? It needs to be omega-powerful to rise above, or have content designed that mandates its use. In PvM, its pretty much only used where the multi-hit of barrages is necessary, the freeze for nibblers in inferno, or healing at places where long trips are good, like GWD and DK's. Other than that, its slayer for burst tasks (which were content added to suit the spellbook, wasn't always the case).",1

Why is the poll inadequate? The quest is coming with a prayer book and skilling prayers are a pretty glaring hole in what we have available to us. Seems like a good time to add skilling prayers and over 50% agreed.


Also do not complain about reading if you cannot read the rest of my sentance.

There is an implied **and** in that statement.  It must be communicated and(not or) have an idea of implementation. 

That doesn't even go into the fact that the decision was made via email survey. An email survey that I never even recieved.

Communication is key and it was woefully inadequate with this decision.",0

We shouldn't be offered options they have zero idea how to do as though they're viable things to make.

>There are currently more pures that participate in pvm or skilling than pures that actively participate in 1v1 pvp. (Which is probably also news to you). It means that the prays are not tool to bully normal billys in pvp but to increase power of any account willing to quest grandmaster quest series and train prayer to gain more power. Makes sense, no?

No.  I'm familiar with many pures that spend most of their time engaging in non-pvp content, but that just goes to show how dead pking is, how broken pures are already, and fails to address the elephant in the room regarding a player who chose to limit themselves in a certain way should somehow be insulated against updates which increase the amount of content from which they are excluding themselves from.

You wouldn't be happy about it because it's been a quest reward for 20 years. This isn't an argument. There's prayers locked behind scrolls in the Modern Prayer book, there's no reason why that can't be the case here. No rule that when you unlock something, you must unlock al lot it.

>My point is not EVERYTHING in this game should be RNG locked.

Nobody said it is. Everything isn't RNG locked. Like the prayer book, you do the quest and BAM! Unlocked!

Some content being untradeable is fine. Fire Cape and Infernal Cape are guaranteed drops from doing something where the only reason you’re doing it is for the cape. 

In the case of the prayers, you’re doing the quest already to unlock the prayers, then further locking the content on top of that on a boss.

I don’t give a fuck what people do with irl money in this game. If they want to bond it up for a prayer then let them have fun doing it.

Needs to be multiple attack styles, no way to pray against, high amount of damage, low accuracy, no defense pot or shield currently used, **and** survival is more important than DPS.

That last is really worth mentioning, because if you're going to take damage with withstand then you'll be taking damage anyways. But since you're *dealing* more damage, you'll be dealt that damage for less time.

Okay well if we can't do what was polled, poll it again.

This is a slippery slope. The poll questions themselves don't even allow for much choice. Do you want this prayer or that prayer? But where is the option for ""neither of these"" ?

This is an abuse of the poll system just like several we've seen in the past year or two.

""Here is the poll, we'll probably do some of these things if they pass""

Which is what they did. The vast majority of responses wanted skilling prayers in their own prayer book.

But also I think you're fundamentally misunderstanding these polls. They did not poll and pass skilling prayers. I'll remind you what you voted for

> This is something we know might be a bit out of the box, so just to test the waters, here’s an advisory poll: Which of the following should the Ruinous Powers prayers focus on?

That wasn't a binding poll. That was a ""do you want us to look into this?"". They looked into it, they didn't execute well, the community told them how they feel, and they listened by deciding to move those to a different prayer book. This sounds like devs listening to player feedback.",1
2227,jbhic7w,"> especially considering that prayer is currently only used for combat.

yes, which is why we pushed for, and passed the poll, on this first new prayer book having skilling prayers.

> Ancients is the primary spell book used in PvP (i.e., an entire category of combat encounters in the game), is used at Muspah, is basically the only spellbook used in the Inferno, is used at ToB (where it's essential for the Maiden of Sugadinti, not only the Nylo room), is often used at ToA, is used at the GWD and pretty much any other place where additional healing is useful, plus it's used at a host of other PvM encounters I'm probably forgetting. I really don't see Lunars used all that often for PvM personally, and the only reason to use the Arceus spellbook for PvM is for Thralls (which is a good reason, don't get me wrong).

I dont get the point of this paragraph. I agree ancients is used. Some of your examples are places it is *worse* to use at though. And arceuss has death charge, thralls, corruption (though no real place of use for that yet).

> It seems to me from this that Ancient Magicks is probably the most used alternate spellbook.

DK's, ToB, Inferno, GWD, PvP.

Arceuss is *easily* the most used alternate spellbook. Its not even close. Anywhere you don't **require** a spell from a different spellbook, arceus is BiS. Its also used for nothing outside of combat, whereas all other books are.

See the downside of having a combat only book? It needs to be omega-powerful to rise above, or have content designed that mandates its use. In PvM, its pretty much only used where the multi-hit of barrages is necessary, the freeze for nibblers in inferno, or healing at places where long trips are good, like GWD and DK's. Other than that, its slayer for burst tasks (which were content added to suit the spellbook, wasn't always the case).",1

Not remotely what im saying.

> If not, you get to riot and kick and scream and shit yourself over the fact that they didn't, and it's perfectly justified because of an early poll meant to gauge interest in skilling prayers.

Aren't you the one doing this? I suggested they shouldn't abandon an idea that passed a poll on 1 round of bad feedback, afterall they didn't hard abandon people disliking the combat prayers. You're having the tantrum about me suggesting that.

> Jagex has let you down for the last time and you are going to make sure they pay for it. Charge back your mom's credit card because this is too far.

This current prayer book really has no reason to prevent 1T flicking, besides cruor's vow, which imo really needs to change to something like a sun keris KO effect (heal hp, drains your prayer) to be balanced. 1% of your DPS as healing, while not insanely strong, feels kinda meh. you're basically just lazy flicking that to be efficient in any pvm situation, or not using it at all. And they can't buff it because then it's OP in a lazy flick situation.

Maybe low drain rate, but every time it heals you, you lose prayer equal to what you healed? then you could buff the healing rate with it still having an objective prayer cost regardless of flicking. Or even just a nerfed version of the sun keris KO effect as the prayer itself.",1
