No walk unders or stalls, she attacks 75 times (4t attack speed).  P2 isnt effected by 90% Prot as it maxes 3-5 at max distance, 1-2 current Prot.  All other hits her max hit goes up by 2, so assume +2 damage per hit compared to standards.  25 hits per phase. But p3 you\\'re spread, so 4.16 hits per player. 60/40 split pref melee in all other phases. So 2.5 melee hits per player per phase, 10 mage hits.  Meaning each player takes 4.16 mage hits p3, 7.5 melee his, and 30 mage hits that hurt you more due to 90% Prot.  So 41.66 hits, call it 42.  So for 90% Prot you take 84 more damage than current. But you hit for 666 damage, meaning you heal 6, down to 78.  So for the power of RP you need 4.8, call it 5, more doses of brew.  \\n\\nExcept you deal 7% more dps due to annihilate, meaning you still heal 6, but only take 80 more damage, so 4.6 doses.  With reflects? Nex takes 80*6 damage, 480, which is 12% of her total. So your team was dealing 22.2 to her to kill her in 3 mins.  22.2x1.07 is 23.77, but she only \"has\" 3520 hp now, meaning it takes 148 secs to kill her.  Shaving off 32 secs means she hits 13 ess times, which sure means she takes a bit less reflect (26), but you also take less damage. Of those 13 hits, you save 1.3 melee hits and 5.2 mage hits.  So now you take 13 less extra damage, down to 71, but still heal 5 because you hit 586 on her, down to 66, so for 1 extra brew you shave 32 secs (17% faster kills) off your kill time.  This is the issue of compounding extra damage with more healing.  Yes, ice vow would be better, but if people complain to make blood vow better, then were talking saving even more supplies, which then snowballs as more new equipment is added.  And Nex is the definition of a chip damage boss, the effect is even stronger at other bosses that aren\\'t already brew fests.\\n\\nThe math prob gets wonky in there somewhere.  And you can reduce damage taken doing walk unders or stalls, minimizing extra damage taken.  If you reduce her to 60 attacks from 75 with walk unders you take that 71 down to 56, still healing 5. So now we\\'re at needing 3 extra doses of brew to kill her 17% faster. Ice is so much better so now it\\'s 2% heal, so now we only need 2 extra doses for the power, etc. The universal effects like weak soul split snowball heavily, and we don\\'t need that in game.

That being said, neither was blood fury on release.  This can be buffed due to complaint same as blood fury was, there isn\\'t a good reason to add it.\\n\\nSang is like 8% healing, blood fury is 6%.  They also have drawbacks.

The shadow vow relates to shadow, but def instead of attack.  The smoke vow has an interesting, albeit probably limited interaction and fits with the poison theme.\\n\\nId rather see the blood vow do something unique and new.  Seemingly all blood related things in Osrs heal.  Sang, blood fury, blood spells.  Scythe skips this, but that\\'s more due to it being a scythe than the blood charges.\\n\\nMaybe something like a bleed? A DoT like poison, but ramps up as you do more damage.  Something like 5% of damage dealt to the boss is stored as a bleed, damage is dealt as 10% of the blood stack is used up, deals 1 damage per used stack every 5 ticks.  Avoids the poison issue of \"flinch to poison, wait till it dies or repeat\". You have to continually be in combat to stack it up, maybe the entire stack disappears after 10 ticks with no new stack.\\n\\nOr other tie-ins of the opponent is bloodied/battered/etc.  The opponent is hurt, so moves slower, slightly more likely to miss, their max hit goes down, etc.  Maybe the opponent is heavily damaged, so we\\'re slightly more likely to hit when the opponent is under half health.  Or under opponent half health our minimum hit is 1 instead of 0, if you pass the attack roll.  \"Bloodletting\" kind of effects rather than healing kind of effects.\\n\\nUniversal healing effects aren\\'t good long term for the game. Admittedly 1% is low, but I think the team will get pressure to make the heal stronger, just like with blood fury.

So for the power of RP you need 4.8, call it 5, more doses of brew.  \\n\\nExcept you deal 7% more dps due to annihilate, meaning you still heal 6, but only take 80 more damage, so 4.6 doses.

However it is known that he at some point arrived on the vampyre world of Vampyrium, where he became known as the Stranger from Afar, he taught the vampyres of culture and society, and changed them from hunting animals to more civilized beings.\"*\\n\\n*\"Zaros arrived at Gielinor during the beginning of the Second Age, where he started building an empire together with his followers.\"*\\n\\n*\"Over the course of several centuries, Zaros\\'s empire grew to massive size, stretching more land than any kingdom ever established since, and the god ruled with force, aiming to put the entirety of Gielinor under his control. Its capital remained Senntisten, a large city in the south of the empire and the most advanced settlement of its time, possibly rivalling the elven city Prifddinas.\"*\\n\\nIt **rivalled Prifddinas** as being the most advanced settlement. Does Priffdinas not invovle skilling? Hell most people point to Seren as a god option for a Skilling Book.\\n\\nIts this complete lack of knowledge of the base lore to these gods which is why i\\'m sick of reading \"it doesn\\'t fit\". Yes Zaros is dark energy and Seren is light energy. And Zaros preferred to rule through force. Thats represented in the combat prayers. Skilling still **exists** in a incredibly succesful massive empire ruled by a god who taught culture and society, civilised vampyres, build the most sophisticated settlement of its time etc. This doesn\\'t happen by \"swing sword harder\".\\n\\n> On the topic of what\\'s easily justified in lore versus requiring the generation of whole new lore, let\\'s write a single line of hypothetical exposition dialogue from DT2 that makes sense of this prayer: \"The Zarosian hordes, driven by fervor for their dark master, covered vast swaths of land in mere days when it should have taken weeks. Their marches were relentless.\" We can easily envision why this might have been relevant in the age of the god wars. That makes it thematically interesting!\\n\\nI agree this prayer can be included btw. I\\'m simply using it to point out the hypocrisy in the logic of \"skilling prayers can\\'t thematically fit a war god like Zaros\". We gotta be consistent if we\\'re gonna be misinformed. But yes, i want this prayer, its a good idea, and lore can easily explain its usage.\\n\\n> I\\'d take this a step further and say that none of the ideas we\\'ve seen for skilling prayers are all that legit. It\\'s easy for the playerbase to say it wants something while doing zero legwork to consider whether it\\'s actually an interesting idea.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen plenty. The easy low hanging fruit is just toning down League relics and making them a prayer. Chance for double harvest, chance to auto bank, chance to auto destroy, boosts become static like Divines, farming harvest is auto-noted, increased farming yield prayers etc. The list goes on.\\n\\nYou know what these compare to with combats? \"Do 20% more damage and be 20% more accurate\". Theres no gameplay there, but its a great prayer. Because prayers are *simple buffs*.\\n\\n> For what it\\'s worth, over 50 percent of the playerbase voted for combat and skilling prayers in balanced amounts. The devs struggled to put forth even three ideas for how prayers could impact skilling. So in a sense, we have already seen the poll result circumvented.\\n\\nYes, this is what im complainng about. Lack of effort towards the poll result into then a \"well nobody liked it so we\\'re ditching it\". Its disingenous.\\n\\n> Moreover, I think more people are coming to the realization that the idea of skillling prayers is much cooler that skilling prayers in practice.\\n\\nI really don\\'t think this is true. The people saying this rhetoric are often ones who didn\\'t want them in the first place, or who seriously overvalue what prayers do. Combat prayers are just different versions of \"do more damage\" or \"take less damage\". They have interesting uses due to the content they are used in, not because they themselves are inherently good gameplay loops.\\n\\n> Sorry for the long replies. I recognize these things are all my opinion, and you\\'re entitled to disagree, but I do honestly think this is a case of the playerbase wanting a piece of content that is difficult to realize, and that will at best be mediocre and at worst be a complete waste of development time.\\n\\nDon\\'t be sorry for long replies.

We got repeated efforts of \"GUYS THIS IS JUST TO PUT THEM IN BETA, TRY THEM OUT AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK!!!\" but with skilling prayers? \"Yeh it seems people dont want it, idea ditched\".

I'm aware of the lore, and it doesn't change my view. The idea that skilling, civilization, culture, etc. all may have happened in a civilization doesn't usurp that most of what we see embodied in the values of that civilization involve control through force. Their spellbook is the only one of the four we have available that is as focused and streamlined, and is notably the only book of the four to have no skilling-related spells. Surely at the very least you can agree it's hardly a natural fit, and it does require some substantial legwork to justify compared to a full-on combat prayer book.\\n\\nYou'll find no disagreement from me that the current combat proposals aren't super exciting. I feel like they need to lean a bit more into the high risk high reward elements, and this most recent revision is a bit better, but still not quite what I'd hoped.\\n\\nI like the leagues relic idea, but it's a little at odds with the idea you presented earlier that there aren't enough good ideas for a full skilling prayer book, given that there's really no shortage of skilling relics. Moreover, I think it's very hard in practice to make a skilling book full of league relics to walk the line between dead content and overpowered. A 5% chance to bank a resource you collect probably isn't worth it, while a 50% chance is a bit high.\\n\\nI tend to agree that these ideas need more time in the oven, but that's why I'd prefer skilling prayers to be part of a different prayer expansion, maybe in tandem with the new skill as a massive skilling expansion package.

I won't address all of your points, but having read your arguments I feel comfortable stating the following.\\n\\nI understand that an empire existed, but I still don't think building an empire long ago in lore in and of itself is enough to ground half a book's worth of skilling prayers. I'm aware of the lore, and it doesn't change my view. The idea that skilling, civilization, culture, etc. all may have happened in a civilization doesn't usurp that most of what we see embodied in the values of that civilization involve control through force. Their spellbook is the only one of the four we have available that is as focused and streamlined, and is notably the only book of the four to have no skilling-related spells. Surely at the very least you can agree it's hardly a natural fit, and it does require some substantial legwork to justify compared to a full-on combat prayer book.\\n\\nYou'll find no disagreement from me that the current combat proposals aren't super exciting. I feel like they need to lean a bit more into the high risk high reward elements, and this most recent revision is a bit better, but still not quite what I'd hoped.\\n\\nI like the leagues relic idea, but it's a little at odds with the idea you presented earlier that there aren't enough good ideas for a full skilling prayer book, given that there's really no shortage of skilling relics. Moreover, I think it's very hard in practice to make a skilling book full of league relics to walk the line between dead content and overpowered. A 5% chance to bank a resource you collect probably isn't worth it, while a 50% chance is a bit high.\\n\\nI tend to agree that these ideas need more time in the oven, but that's why I'd prefer skilling prayers to be part of a different prayer expansion, maybe in tandem with the new skill as a massive skilling expansion package.

It just adds a tedium of changing books every time you change activity. Doing pvm? Onto the ruinous powers. Doing skilling? Time to always swap to this specific book.\\n\\nIt just adds an unnecessary step. Just add prayers to the existing book(s). We don\\'t have 20 skilling prayer ideas that need to exist.
